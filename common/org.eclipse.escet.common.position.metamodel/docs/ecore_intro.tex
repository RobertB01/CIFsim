In this report, the \ecorelang{} language is defined. The \ecorelang{}
language is defined using a so-called \emph{conceptual model}, also known as
\emph{metamodel} by the Object Management Group (OMG). A metamodel represents
concepts (entities) and relationships between them. The \ecorelang{} metamodel
is described using (Ecore) class diagrams~\cite{Steinberg4:EMFBook09}, where
classes represent concepts, and associations represent relationships between
concepts. Static semantic constraints and relations that cannot be represented
using class diagrams are stated in the class documentation of the metamodel.
The metamodel and the accompanying constraints are used primarily to formalize
the syntax of the internal (implementation) representation of the language.
