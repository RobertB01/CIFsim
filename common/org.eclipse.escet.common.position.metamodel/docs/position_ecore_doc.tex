\chapter{Introduction}
The position language is a language to represent position information, for
source tracking. A position is represented as a continuous region in a textual
source (the \emph{source text}). This language is typically not used by itself,
but other languages can use this language to provide position information
storage. By using a common language for position information, the position
information can be handled generically by e.g. parsers, type checkers and text
editors.

The position language is part of the common functionality provided by the
Eclipse ESCET\textsuperscript{\texttrademark{}} project~\cite{Eclipse:ESCET}.

The Eclipse ESCET project, including the position language, is
currently in the \emph{Incubation Phase}~\cite{Eclipse:Incubation}.
