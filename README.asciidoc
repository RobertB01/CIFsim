= Welcome to the Eclipse ESCET(TM) repository!

The Eclipse Supervisory Control Engineering Toolkit (Eclipse ESCET(TM)) project provides a toolkit for the development of supervisory controllers.
The toolkit has a strong focus on industrial applicability, e.g. to cyber-physical systems.
The toolkit includes tooling to support the entire development process of (supervisory) controllers, including among others specification, supervisory controller synthesis, simulation-based validation and visualization, formal verification, real-time testing, and code generation.
