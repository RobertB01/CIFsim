\chapter{Introduction}

Chi is a modeling language for describing and analyzing performance of
discrete event systems by means of simulation.
It uses a process-based view, and uses synchronous point-to-point
communication between processes. A process is written as an imperative
program, with a syntax much inspired by the well-known Python language.

Chi is one of the tools of the Eclipse ESCET\textsuperscript{\texttrademark{}}
project~\cite{Eclipse:ESCET}.

The Eclipse ESCET project, including the Chi language and toolset, is
currently in the \emph{Incubation Phase}~\cite{Eclipse:Incubation}.

\todo{Add general introduction texts about Ecore models/diagrams, from
position metamodel, similar to position and CIF metamodel documentation.}


\chapter{EMF model constraints}
In this chapter, the static constraints on a Chi ecore model are listed.

\section{Addressable expressions}\label{sect:addressable-expressions}
In the ecore model, attributes \chiattr{AssignmentStatement.lhs} and
\chiattr{ReceiveStatement.data} should be addressable, they should refer to
variables that can be assigned a value.
In the ecore model however, these attributes have the generic
\chiclass{Expression} type. In this section, additional constraints are
specified to consider an \chiclass{Expression} object as being addressable.

The (recursive) constraints are:
\begin{enumerate}
\item If the expression is a \chiclass{VariableReference}, the expression is
    addressable.
\item If the expression is a \chiclass{BinaryExpression}, and its
    \chiattr{BinaryExpression.operator} attribute is
    \chienumlit{BinaryOperators.Projection}, and the left-hand side
    (\chiattr{BinaryExpression.left}) is a \chiclass{VariableReference} or a
    \chiclass{BinaryExpression}, and the left-hand side is addressable,
    the expression is addressable.
\item If the expression is a \chiclass{TupleExpression}, and all of its
    fields are addressable, the expression is addressable.
\end{enumerate}
