WARNING: File "cif2cif/remove_reqs_invalid.cif": Semantic warning at line 48, column 15: The switch has only one "case", which will be deprecated in the future.
ERROR: File "cif2cif/remove_reqs_invalid.cif": Unsatisfied precondition for CIF to CIF transformation.
CAUSE: Removing requirements from a CIF specification failed due to the remaining part of the specification using declarations that are declared in the requirement automata that are to be removed, or a location of a requirement automaton contains invariants that cannot be removed:
 - Location "b" of requirement automaton "k" contains a kindless invariant.
 - Location "b" of requirement automaton "k" contains a plant invariant.
 - Location "b" of requirement automaton "k" contains a supervisor invariant.
 - Requirement automaton "a" contains declaration "x" that is used somewhere in the top level scope of the specification.
 - Requirement automaton "a" contains declaration "y" that is used somewhere in the top level scope of the specification.
 - Requirement automaton "g.h.i.j.r" contains declaration "l1" that is used somewhere in group "g.h".
 - Requirement automaton "g.h.i.j.r" is used somewhere in group "g.h".
 - Requirement automaton "h.i.a" contains declaration "x" that is used somewhere in group "h".
 - Requirement automaton "h.i.a" contains declaration "y" that is used somewhere in group "h".
 - Requirement automaton "r" contains declaration "i" that is used somewhere in the top level scope of the specification.
