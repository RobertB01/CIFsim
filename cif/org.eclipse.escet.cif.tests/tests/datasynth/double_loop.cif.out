Computing initialization predicate of the controlled system.

Controlled system: exactly 2,110 states.

Determining initialization predicate for output model:
    Initial (synthesis result):            <bdd 105n 1,102p>
    Initial (uncontrolled system):         <bdd 14n 64p>
    Initial (controlled system):           <bdd 18n 55p>
    Initial (removed by supervisor):       <bdd 29n 95p>
    Initial (added by supervisor):         <bdd 29n 207p>

    Simplifying of controlled system initialization predicate under the assumption of the uncontrolled system initialization predicates:
        Initial: <bdd 18n 55p> -> <bdd 13n 55p> [assume <bdd 14n 64p>].

    Initial (output model):                <bdd 13n 55p>

Determining supervisor guards for output model:
    Event c1: guard: <bdd 21n 56p>.
    Event c2: guard: <bdd 21n 77p>.

Checking post-synthesis for events that are never enabled.

Simplifying supervisor guards for output model:
    Simplification under the assumption of the plants.

    Event c1: guard: <bdd 21n 56p> -> <bdd 17n 56p> [assume p.m2].
    Event c2: guard: <bdd 21n 77p> -> <bdd 17n 77p> [assume p.m2].
