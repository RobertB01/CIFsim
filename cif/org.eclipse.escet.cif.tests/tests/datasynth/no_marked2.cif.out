Reading CIF file "datasynth/no_marked2.cif".

Preprocessing CIF specification (includes checking that the specification is supported).

Converting CIF specification to internal format (BDDs):

Checking input for potential problems.

Restricting edge guards to prevent runtime errors:
    No guards changed.

Restricting uncontrolled system behavior using state/event exclusion plant invariants:

Initializing edges for being applied.

Restricting uncontrolled system behavior using state plant invariants:
    No restrictions needed.

Initializing controlled behavior:
    Controlled-behavior predicate: true.
    Controlled-initialization predicate: p.x = 2 or p.x = 3.

Extending controlled-behavior predicate using variable ranges:

Computing initialization predicate of the controlled system.

Controlled system: exactly 0 states.

Determining initialization predicate for output model:
