Synthesis round 1:
    Computing backward controlled-behavior predicate:
        Backward controlled-behavior: true [marker predicate]
        Backward controlled-behavior: true -> p.x = 0 or (p.x = 2 or p.x = 4) [restricted to current/previous controlled-behavior predicate: p.x = 0 or (p.x = 2 or p.x = 4)]

        Backward reachability iteration 1:
            No change this iteration.

        Backward controlled-behavior: p.x = 0 or (p.x = 2 or p.x = 4) [fixed point].

        Controlled behavior not changed.

    Computing forward controlled-behavior predicate:

        Backward controlled-behavior: true [marker predicate]
        Backward controlled-behavior: true -> p.x = 2 [restricted to current/previous controlled-behavior predicate: p.x = 2]

Computing controlled system guards.

Edge (event: next) (guard: true) (assignments: p.x := (p.x + 1) mod count): guard: true -> p.x = 1.
