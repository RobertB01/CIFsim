Restricting behavior using state/event exclusion requirements.

Round 1: started.

Round 1: computing backward controlled-behavior predicate.
Backward controlled-behavior: true [marker predicate]
Backward reachability: iteration 1.

Round 1: computing backward uncontrolled bad-state predicate.
Backward uncontrolled bad-state: false [current/previous controlled behavior predicate]
Backward reachability: iteration 1.

Round 1: computing forward controlled-behavior predicate.
Forward controlled-behavior: true [initialization predicate]
Forward reachability: iteration 1.

Round 1: finished, controlled behavior is stable.

Computing controlled system guards.

Final synthesis result:
  State: (controlled-behavior: true)
    Edge: (event: sup2) (guard: true)

Controlled system:                     exactly 1 state.
