WARNING: File "datasynth/multi_req_invs2.cif": Semantic warning at line 27, column 12: The alphabet of automaton "r" globally disables event "d", as the event is not used on any of the edges of the automaton.
WARNING: Event d is never enabled in the input specification, taking into account automaton guards and state/event exclusion invariants.
