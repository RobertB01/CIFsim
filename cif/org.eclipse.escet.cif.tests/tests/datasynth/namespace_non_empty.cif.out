Reading CIF file "datasynth/namespace_non_empty.cif".
Preprocessing CIF specification (includes checking that the specification is supported).
Converting CIF specification to internal format (BDDs):
    The specification has no BDD variables.

Starting data-based synthesis.

    Uncontrolled system:

            Edge: (event: g.h.c) (guard: true)
            Edge: (event: g.h.u) (guard: true)

Restricting edge guards to prevent runtime errors:
    No guards changed.

Restricting uncontrolled system behavior using state/event exclusion plant invariants:
    No guards changed.

Initializing edges for being applied.

Restricting uncontrolled system behavior using state plant invariants:
    No restrictions needed.

Initializing controlled behavior:
    Controlled-behavior predicate: true.
    Controlled-initialization predicate: true.

Restricting behavior using state requirements:
    Controlled behavior not changed.

Extending controlled-behavior predicate using variable ranges:
    Controlled behavior not changed.

Restricting behavior using state/event exclusion requirements:
    Guards and controlled behavior not changed.

Restricting behavior using implicit runtime error requirements:
    Controlled behavior not changed.

Re-initializing edges for being applied.

Checking pre-synthesis for events that are never enabled.

Synthesis round 1:
    Computing backward controlled-behavior predicate:
        Backward controlled-behavior: true [marker predicate]

        Backward reachability iteration 1:
            No change this iteration.

        Controlled behavior not changed.

    Computing backward uncontrolled bad-state predicate:
        Backward uncontrolled bad-state: false [current/previous controlled behavior predicate]

        Backward reachability iteration 1:
            No change this iteration.

        Controlled behavior not changed.

    Computing forward controlled-behavior predicate:
        Forward controlled-behavior: true [initialization predicate]

        Forward reachability iteration 1:
            No change this iteration.

        Controlled behavior not changed.

    Finished: controlled behavior is stable.

Computing controlled system guards.

Final synthesis result:
    State: (controlled-behavior: true)
        Edge: (event: g.h.c) (guard: true)
        Edge: (event: g.h.u) (guard: true)

Controlled system: exactly 1 state.

Initial (synthesis result):            true
Initial (uncontrolled system):         true
Initial (controlled system):           true
