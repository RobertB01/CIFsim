Computing controlled system guards.

Edge (event: machine1.c_start) (guard: machine1.Idle) (assignments: machine1.producing := 1, machine1 := machine1.Producing): guard: machine1.Idle -> machine1.Idle and (machine2.producing = 0 and not machine2.Producing).

Initial (uncontrolled system):         machine1.Idle and machine1.producing = 0 and (machine2.producing = 0 and machine2.Idle)
Initial (controlled system):           machine1.Idle and machine1.producing = 0 and (machine2.producing = 0 and machine2.Idle)
Initial (removed by supervisor):       false
Initial (added by supervisor):         true

Simplification of controlled system under the assumption of the plants:
  Event machine1.c_start: guard: machine1.Idle and (machine2.producing = 0 and not machine2.Producing) -> machine2.producing = 0 and not machine2.Producing [assume machine1.Idle].
  Event machine2.c_start: guard: not machine1.Producing and (machine1.producing = 0 and machine2.Idle) -> not machine1.Producing and machine1.producing = 0 [assume machine2.Idle].
