Backward uncontrolled bad-state: a.x = 0 or (a.x = 24 or a.x = 22) or (a.x = 25 or (a.x = 21 or a.x = 23)) [current/previous controlled behavior predicate]
Backward reachability: iteration 1.

Round 2: finished, controlled behavior is stable.

Computing controlled system guards.

Final synthesis result:
    State: (controlled-behavior: a.x != 0 and a.x != 24 and (a.x != 22 and (a.x != 25 and not(a.x = 21 or a.x = 23))))
        Edge: (event: e) (guard: 0 <= a.x and (a.x <= 23 and not(20 <= a.x and a.x <= 23))) (assignments: a.x := a.x + 1)
        Edge: (event: f) (guard: true -> a.x = 12 or (a.x = 13 or a.x = 10) or (a.x = 11 or (a.x = 14 or a.x = 15)))
        Edge: (event: g) (guard: true -> a.x = 12 or a.x = 14 or (a.x = 13 or a.x = 11))
        Edge: (event: h) (guard: true -> a.x = 12 or a.x = 13)
        Edge: (event: i) (guard: 0 <= a.x and (a.x <= 23 and not(20 <= a.x and a.x <= 23))) (assignments: a.x := a.x + 1)
        Edge: (event: j) (guard: true -> a.x = 12 or (a.x = 13 or a.x = 10) or (a.x = 11 or (a.x = 14 or a.x = 15)))
        Edge: (event: k) (guard: true -> a.x = 12 or a.x = 14 or (a.x = 13 or a.x = 11))
        Edge: (event: l) (guard: true -> a.x = 12 or a.x = 13)

Controlled system: exactly 20 states.

Initial (synthesis result):            a.x != 0 and a.x != 24 and (a.x != 22 and (a.x != 25 and not(a.x = 21 or a.x = 23)))
Initial (uncontrolled system):         a.x = 1
Initial (controlled system):           a.x = 1
Initial (removed by supervisor):       false
Initial (added by supervisor):         true

Simplification of controlled system under the assumption of the plants:
    Event e: guard: 0 <= a.x and (a.x <= 23 and not(20 <= a.x and a.x <= 23)) -> true [assume 0 <= a.x and (a.x <= 23 and not(20 <= a.x and a.x <= 23))].
