        Edge: (event: p.u_inc) (guard: (p.x = 0 or p.x = 4) and p.increase or (p.x = 2 and p.increase or (p.x = 1 or p.x = 3) and p.increase)) (assignments: p.x := p.x + 1)
        Edge: (event: p.u_switch) (guard: p.x = 0 and p.decrease or p.x = 5 and p.increase) (assignments: p := p.decrease / p := p.increase)
        Edge: (event: p.u_dec) (guard: p.x = 4 and p.decrease or (p.x = 2 and p.decrease or (p.x = 1 or (p.x = 3 or p.x = 5)) and p.decrease)) (assignments: p.x := p.x - 1)

Computing initialization predicate of the controlled system.

Controlled system: exactly 12 states.

Determining initialization predicate for output model:
    Initial (synthesis result):            true
    Initial (uncontrolled system):         p.x = 0 and p.increase
    Initial (controlled system):           p.x = 0 and p.increase
    Initial (removed by supervisor):       false
    Initial (added by supervisor):         true

    Initial (output model):                n/a

Determining supervisor guards for output model:
    No controllable events.

Checking post-synthesis for events that are never enabled.

Simplifying supervisor guards for output model:
    Simplification under the assumption of the plants.

    Guards not changed.
