Round 2: computing backward uncontrolled bad-state predicate.
Backward uncontrolled bad-state: <bdd 21n 22p> [current/previous controlled behavior predicate]
Backward reachability: iteration 1.

Round 2: finished, controlled behavior is stable.

Computing controlled system guards.

Edge (event: c1) (guard: p.m0) (assignments: p := p.m1): guard: p.m0 -> p.x = 3 and p.m0.
Edge (event: c2) (guard: p.m2) (assignments: p.x := p.x + 1): guard: p.m2 -> p.x = 3 and p.m2.

Final synthesis result:
  State: (controlled-behavior: <bdd 21n 5p>)
    Edge: (event: c1) (guard: p.m0 -> p.x = 3 and p.m0) (assignments: p := p.m1)
    Edge: (event: u2) (guard: p.m1) (assignments: p.x := p.x + 1, p := p.m2)
    Edge: (event: u1) (guard: p.m2) (assignments: p.x := p.x + 1, p := p.m3)
    Edge: (event: u1) (guard: p.m3) (assignments: p.x := p.x + 1, p := p.m4)
    Edge: (event: u1) (guard: p.m4) (assignments: p.x := p.x + 1, p := p.m5)
    Edge: (event: c2) (guard: p.m2 -> p.x = 3 and p.m2) (assignments: p.x := p.x + 1)

Controlled system: exactly 6 states.

Initial (synthesis result):            <bdd 21n 5p>
Initial (uncontrolled system):         p.x = 3 and p.m0
Initial (controlled system):           p.x = 3 and p.m0
Initial (removed by supervisor):       false
Initial (added by supervisor):         true

Simplification of controlled system under the assumption of the plants:
  Event c1: guard: p.x = 3 and p.m0 -> p.x = 3 [assume p.m0].
  Event c2: guard: p.x = 3 and p.m2 -> p.x = 3 [assume p.m2].
