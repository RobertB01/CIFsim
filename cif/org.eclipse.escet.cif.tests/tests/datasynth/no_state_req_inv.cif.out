Initializing edges for being applied.

Restricting uncontrolled system behavior using state plant invariants:
    No restrictions needed.

Initializing controlled behavior:
    Controlled-behavior predicate: true.
    Controlled-initialization predicate: p.x = 2 or p.x = 3.

Restricting behavior using state requirements:
    Controlled behavior: true -> false [state requirements: false].

Extending controlled-behavior predicate using variable ranges:
    Controlled behavior not changed.

Restricting behavior using state/event exclusion requirements:
    Guards and controlled behavior not changed.

    Controlled behavior not changed.

Re-initializing edges for being applied.

Checking pre-synthesis for events that are never enabled.

Synthesis round 1:
    Computing backward controlled-behavior predicate:
        Backward controlled-behavior: true [marker predicate]
        Backward controlled-behavior: true -> false [restricted to current/previous controlled-behavior predicate: false]

        Backward controlled-behavior: false [fixed point].

        Controlled behavior not changed.

    Finished: all states are bad.

Computing final controlled system guards:
    No guards changed.

Final synthesis result:
    State: (controlled-behavior: false)

Controlled system: exactly 0 states.
