State/event exclusion plants:
  None

State/event exclusion requirements:
  Event "e1a" needs:
    2 <= p1.x and p1.x <= 5
  Event "e1b" needs:
    p1.x = 4 or p1.x = 5

Uncontrolled system:
  State: (controlled-behavior: ?)
    Edge: (event: e1a) (guard: p1.x = 4 or (p1.x = 5 or p1.x = 3))
    Edge: (event: e1a) (guard: false)
    Edge: (event: e1b) (guard: p1.x = 4 or p1.x = 5)
    Edge: (event: e1b) (guard: p1.x = 3)

Restricting behavior using state/event exclusion plants.

Initialized controlled-behavior predicate using invariants: true.

Extending controlled-behavior predicate using variable ranges.

Controlled behavior: true -> true [range: true, variable: discrete variable "p1.x" of type "int[0..5]" (group: 0, domain: 0+1, BDD variables: 3, CIF/BDD values: 6/8)].

Extended controlled-behavior predicate using variable ranges: true.

Restricting behavior using state/event exclusion requirements.

Edge (event: e1b) (guard: p1.x = 3): guard: p1.x = 3 -> false [requirement: p1.x = 4 or p1.x = 5].

Restricted behavior using state/event exclusion requirements:
  State: (controlled-behavior: true)
    Edge: (event: e1a) (guard: p1.x = 4 or (p1.x = 5 or p1.x = 3))
    Edge: (event: e1a) (guard: false)
    Edge: (event: e1b) (guard: p1.x = 4 or p1.x = 5)
    Edge: (event: e1b) (guard: p1.x = 3 -> false)

Round 1: started.

Round 1: computing backward controlled-behavior predicate.
Backward controlled-behavior: true [marker predicate]
Backward controlled-behavior: true -> true [restricted to current/previous controlled-behavior predicate: true]
Backward reachability: iteration 1.
Backward controlled-behavior: true [fixed point].

Round 1: computing backward uncontrolled bad-state predicate.
Backward uncontrolled bad-state: false [current/previous controlled behavior predicate]
Backward reachability: iteration 1.

Round 1: computing forward controlled-behavior predicate.
Forward controlled-behavior: true [initialization predicate]
Forward reachability: iteration 1.

Round 1: finished, controlled behavior is stable.

Computing controlled system guards.

Edge (event: e1a) (guard: p1.x = 4 or (p1.x = 5 or p1.x = 3)): guard: p1.x = 4 or (p1.x = 5 or p1.x = 3) -> p1.x != 0 and (p1.x != 2 and p1.x != 1).
Edge (event: e1b) (guard: p1.x = 4 or p1.x = 5): guard: p1.x = 4 or p1.x = 5 -> p1.x = 4 or p1.x = 5.

Final synthesis result:
  State: (controlled-behavior: true)
    Edge: (event: e1a) (guard: p1.x = 4 or (p1.x = 5 or p1.x = 3) -> p1.x != 0 and (p1.x != 2 and p1.x != 1))
    Edge: (event: e1a) (guard: false)
    Edge: (event: e1b) (guard: p1.x = 4 or p1.x = 5 -> p1.x = 4 or p1.x = 5)
    Edge: (event: e1b) (guard: p1.x = 3 -> false)

Controlled system:                     exactly 6 states.

Initial (synthesis result):            true
Initial (uncontrolled system):         true
Initial (controlled system):           true
Initial (removed by supervisor):       false
Initial (added by supervisor):         true

Simplification of controlled system under the assumption of the plants:
  Event e1a: guard: p1.x != 0 and (p1.x != 2 and p1.x != 1) -> p1.x != 2 [assume p1.x = 4 or (p1.x = 5 or p1.x = 3)].
  Event e1b: guard: p1.x = 4 or p1.x = 5 -> not(p1.x = 2 or p1.x = 3) [assume p1.x = 4 or (p1.x = 5 or p1.x = 3)].
