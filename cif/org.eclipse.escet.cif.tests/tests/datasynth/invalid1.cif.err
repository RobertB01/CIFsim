ERROR: Data-based supervisory controller synthesis failed due to unsatisfied preconditions:
 - Unsupported automaton "aut": only plant and requirement automata are supported.
 - Unsupported automaton "p1": unsupported part "p1.v1 > 0" of initialization predicate "p1.v1 > 0": binary operator ">" on values of types "real" and "int[0..0]" is not supported.
 - Unsupported automaton "r5": unsupported part "-1" of invariant "r5.evt needs r5.v = -1": value "-1" is unsupported, as it is negative.
 - Unsupported automaton "r5": unsupported part "-1" of invariant "r5.v = -1 disables r5.evt": value "-1" is unsupported, as it is negative.
 - Unsupported automaton "r5": unsupported part "-1" of state invariant "r5.v = -1": value "-1" is unsupported, as it is negative.

 - Unsupported automaton "r5": unsupported part "r5.v < 5.0" of state invariant "r5.v < 5.0": binary operator "<" on values of types "int[0..5]" and "real" is not supported.
 - Unsupported automaton "r5": unsupported part "r5.v div -2" of state invariant "r5.v = r5.v div -2": "r5.v div -2" performs division/modulus by a negative value, which is not supported.
 - Unsupported automaton "r5": unsupported part "r5.v div zero" of state invariant "r5.v = r5.v div zero": "r5.v div zero" always results in division by zero.
 - Unsupported automaton "r5": unsupported part "r5.v mod -3" of state invariant "r5.v = r5.v mod -3": "r5.v mod -3" performs division/modulus by a negative value, which is not supported.
 - Unsupported automaton "r5": unsupported part "r5.v mod zero" of state invariant "r5.v = r5.v mod zero": "r5.v mod zero" always results in division by zero.
