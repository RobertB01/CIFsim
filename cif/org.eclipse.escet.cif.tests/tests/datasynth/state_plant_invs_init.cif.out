Synthesis round 1:
    Computing backward controlled-behavior predicate:
        Backward controlled-behavior: true [marker predicate]
        Backward controlled-behavior: true -> true [restricted to current/previous controlled-behavior predicate: true]
        Backward controlled-behavior: true [fixed point].

        Controlled behavior not changed.

    Computing backward uncontrolled bad-state predicate:
        Backward uncontrolled bad-state: false [current/previous controlled behavior predicate]

        Controlled behavior not changed.

    Computing forward controlled-behavior predicate:
        Forward controlled-behavior: A.D != 1 [initialization predicate]

        Controlled behavior: true -> A.D != 1.

    Need another round.

Synthesis round 2:
    Computing backward controlled-behavior predicate:
        Backward controlled-behavior: true [marker predicate]
        Backward controlled-behavior: true -> A.D != 1 [restricted to current/previous controlled-behavior predicate: A.D != 1]
        Backward controlled-behavior: A.D != 1 [fixed point].

    Computing backward uncontrolled bad-state predicate:
        Backward uncontrolled bad-state: A.D = 1 [current/previous controlled behavior predicate]

        Controlled behavior not changed.
