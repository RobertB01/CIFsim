Synthesis round 1:
    Computing backward controlled-behavior predicate:
        Backward controlled-behavior: true [marker predicate]
        Backward controlled-behavior: true -> false [restricted to current/previous controlled-behavior predicate: false]

        Backward reachability iteration 1:
            No change this iteration.

        Backward controlled-behavior: false [fixed point].

        Controlled behavior not changed.

    Finished: all states are bad.

Computing final controlled system guards:
    Edge (event: cen) (guard: true): guard: true -> false.
