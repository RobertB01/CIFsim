State/event exclusion requirements:
  Event "e2b" needs:
    p2.x = 4 or (p2.x = 5 or p2.x = 3)
  Event "e2c" needs:
    p2.x != 1
  Event "e2d" needs:
    p2.x = 4 or p2.x = 5

Uncontrolled system:
  State: (controlled-behavior: ?)
    Edge: (event: e2a) (guard: true) (assignments: p2.x := p2.x + 1)
    Edge: (event: e2b) (guard: p2.x = 5 or p2.x = 3)
    Edge: (event: e2c) (guard: 2 <= p2.x and p2.x <= 5)
    Edge: (event: e2d) (guard: p2.x = 4 or (p2.x = 5 or p2.x = 3))

Initialized controlled-behavior predicate using invariants: true.

Extending controlled-behavior predicate using variable ranges.

Controlled behavior: true -> true [range: true, variable: discrete variable "p2.x" of type "int[0..5]" (group: 0, domain: 0+1, BDD variables: 3, CIF/BDD values: 6/8)].

Extended controlled-behavior predicate using variable ranges: true.

Restricting behavior using state/event exclusion requirements.

Edge (event: e2d) (guard: p2.x = 4 or (p2.x = 5 or p2.x = 3)): guard: p2.x = 4 or (p2.x = 5 or p2.x = 3) -> p2.x = 4 or p2.x = 5 [requirement: p2.x = 4 or p2.x = 5].

Restricted behavior using state/event exclusion requirements:
  State: (controlled-behavior: true)
    Edge: (event: e2a) (guard: true) (assignments: p2.x := p2.x + 1)
    Edge: (event: e2b) (guard: p2.x = 5 or p2.x = 3)
    Edge: (event: e2c) (guard: 2 <= p2.x and p2.x <= 5)
    Edge: (event: e2d) (guard: p2.x = 4 or (p2.x = 5 or p2.x = 3) -> p2.x = 4 or p2.x = 5)

Round 1: started.

Round 1: computing backward controlled-behavior predicate.
Backward controlled-behavior: true [marker predicate]
Backward controlled-behavior: true -> true [restricted to current/previous controlled-behavior predicate: true]
Backward reachability: iteration 1.
Backward controlled-behavior: true [fixed point].

Round 1: computing backward uncontrolled bad-state predicate.
Backward uncontrolled bad-state: false [current/previous controlled behavior predicate]
Backward reachability: iteration 1.

Round 1: computing forward controlled-behavior predicate.
Forward controlled-behavior: true [initialization predicate]
Forward reachability: iteration 1.

Round 1: finished, controlled behavior is stable.

Computing controlled system guards.

Edge (event: e2a) (guard: true) (assignments: p2.x := p2.x + 1): guard: true -> p2.x != 5.
Edge (event: e2c) (guard: 2 <= p2.x and p2.x <= 5): guard: 2 <= p2.x and p2.x <= 5 -> 2 <= p2.x and p2.x <= 5.
Edge (event: e2d) (guard: p2.x = 4 or (p2.x = 5 or p2.x = 3) -> p2.x = 4 or p2.x = 5): guard: p2.x = 4 or p2.x = 5 -> p2.x = 4 or p2.x = 5.

Final synthesis result:
  State: (controlled-behavior: true)
    Edge: (event: e2a) (guard: true -> p2.x != 5) (assignments: p2.x := p2.x + 1)
    Edge: (event: e2b) (guard: p2.x = 5 or p2.x = 3)
    Edge: (event: e2c) (guard: 2 <= p2.x and p2.x <= 5 -> 2 <= p2.x and p2.x <= 5)
    Edge: (event: e2d) (guard: p2.x = 4 or (p2.x = 5 or p2.x = 3) -> p2.x = 4 or p2.x = 5)

Controlled system:                     exactly 6 states.

Initial (synthesis result):            true
Initial (uncontrolled system):         true
Initial (controlled system):           true
Initial (removed by supervisor):       false
Initial (added by supervisor):         true

Simplification of controlled system under the assumption of the state/event exclusion requirement invariants:
  Event e2b: guard: p2.x = 5 or p2.x = 3 -> p2.x = 1 or (p2.x = 3 or p2.x = 5) [assume p2.x = 4 or (p2.x = 5 or p2.x = 3)].
  Event e2d: guard: p2.x = 4 or p2.x = 5 -> not(p2.x = 2 or p2.x = 3) [assume p2.x = 4 or p2.x = 5].
