Reading CIF file "datasynth/namespace_conflict.cif".
Preprocessing CIF specification (includes checking that the specification is supported).
Converting CIF specification to internal format (BDDs):
    The specification has no BDD variables.

Starting data-based synthesis.

Showing input and checking for potential problems:
    Invariant (components state plant inv):      true
    Invariant (locations state plant invariant): true
    Invariant (system state plant invariant):    true

    Invariant (components state req invariant):  true
    Invariant (locations state req invariant):   true
    Invariant (system state req invariant):      true

    Initial   (discrete variables):              true
    Initial   (components init predicate):       true
    Initial   (aut/locs init predicate):         true

    Marked    (system, combined mark/plant inv): true
    Marked    (system, combined mark/state inv): true

    State/event exclusion plants:
        None

    State/event exclusion requirements:
        None

    Uncontrolled system:
        State: (controlled-behavior: ?)
            Edge: (event: g.h.c) (guard: true)

Restricting edge guards to prevent runtime errors:
    No guards changed.

Restricting uncontrolled system behavior using state/event exclusion plant invariants.

Initialized controlled-behavior predicate: true.
Initialized controlled-initialization predicate: true.

Restricting behavior using state requirements.

Extending controlled-behavior predicate using variable ranges.

Restricting behavior using state/event exclusion requirements.

Restricting behavior using implicit runtime error requirements.

Round 1: started.

Round 1: computing backward controlled-behavior predicate.
Backward controlled-behavior: true [marker predicate]
Backward reachability: iteration 1.

Round 1: computing backward uncontrolled bad-state predicate.
Backward uncontrolled bad-state: false [current/previous controlled behavior predicate]

Round 1: computing forward controlled-behavior predicate.
Forward controlled-behavior: true [initialization predicate]
Forward reachability: iteration 1.

Round 1: finished, controlled behavior is stable.

Computing controlled system guards.

Final synthesis result:
    State: (controlled-behavior: true)
        Edge: (event: g.h.c) (guard: true)

Controlled system: exactly 1 state.

Initial (synthesis result):            true
Initial (uncontrolled system):         true
Initial (controlled system):           true
Initial (removed by supervisor):       false
Initial (added by supervisor):         true
