WARNING: File "merger/kind_change_warn.in1.cif": Semantic warning at line 17, column 28: Invariant does not specify a supervisory kind and thus implicitly inherits supervisory kind "plant" from automaton "p". This is deprecated. Please explicitly specify the kind before the "invariant" keyword.

WARNING: Merging group "p" into plant automaton "p" leads to kindless invariant "20 = 20 disables e" from the group implicitly becoming a plant invariant.
WARNING: Merging group "p" into plant automaton "p" leads to kindless invariant "21 = 21" from the group implicitly becoming a plant invariant.
WARNING: Merging group "q" into requirement automaton "q" leads to kindless invariant "30 = 30 disables e" from the group implicitly becoming a requirement invariant.
