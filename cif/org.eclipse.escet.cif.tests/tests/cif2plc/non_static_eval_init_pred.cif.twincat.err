ERROR: PLC code generation failed for CIF file "cif2plc/non_static_eval_init_pred.cif".
CAUSE: CIF PLC code generator failed due to unsatisfied preconditions:
 - Discrete variable has multiple potential initial values (any value in its domain):
   - In automaton "p":
     - disc int x in any;
                ^
 - Failed to determine whether a location is an initial location, as one of its initialization predicates cannot be statically evaluated:
   - In automaton "p":
     - initial x > 0;
                 ^
