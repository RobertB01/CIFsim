ERROR: PLC code generation failed for CIF file "cif2plc/non_static_eval_init_pred.cif".
CAUSE: CIF to PLC transformation failed due to unsatisfied preconditions:
 - Unsupported "p" (File "cif2plc/non_static_eval_init_pred.cif": line 14, column 7): failed to determine whether the automaton's location is an initial location, as one of its initialization predicates cannot be statically evaluated.
 - Unsupported "p.x" (File "cif2plc/non_static_eval_init_pred.cif": line 15, column 12): discrete variable has multiple potential initial values (any value in its domain).
