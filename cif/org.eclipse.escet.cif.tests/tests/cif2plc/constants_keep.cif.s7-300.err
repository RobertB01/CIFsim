 - A list type is used:
   - In the top-level scope of the specification:
     - initial a + b + c + d + cl[0] + x = 10.0;

     - invariant a + b + c + d + cl[0] + x = 10.0;
                                 ^
   - In automaton "aut":
     - invariant a + b + c + d + cl[0] + x = 10.0;
                                 ^
