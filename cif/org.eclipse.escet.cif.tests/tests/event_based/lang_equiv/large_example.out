Automata have a different language!
From location "loc30" of automaton "statespace2", event "start" can be performed, but from the equivalent location "loc30" of automaton "statespace1", the event cannot be performed.
This state pair can be reached with the following sequence of events from the initial state:
1. "enter"
2. "start"
3. "do2"
4. "enter"
5. "start"
6. "enter"
7. "do1"
