ERROR: CIF to Supremica transformation failed due to unsatisfied preconditions:
 - Unsupported "p" (File "cif2supremica/invalid3.cif": line 14, column 7): failed to determine whether the automaton's location is an initial location, as one of its initialization predicates cannot be statically evaluated.
 - Unsupported "p.b" (File "cif2supremica/invalid3.cif": line 15, column 13): discrete variable has multiple potential initial values (any value in its domain).
