WARNING: The input specification has no controller properties annotation that specifies the bounded response property.
WARNING: The input specification has no controller properties annotation that specifies the confluence property.
WARNING: The input specification has no controller properties annotation that specifies the non-blocking under control property.
WARNING: Before generating PLC code, the bounded response, confluence and non-blocking under control properties of the CIF specification should be checked and should hold.
WARNING: Please apply the CIF controller properties checker on the CIF specification before generating PLC code from it.
WARNING: Using control code generated from a CIF specification without bounded response, confluence or non-blocking under control properties may result in undesired or unexpected behavior of the controlled system.
WARNING: Bounded response limit for uncontrollable events is not available, falling back to limitless trying of events until blocked.
