WARNING: The controller properties annotation of the input specification that specifies the confluence property may not hold.
WARNING: The controller properties annotation of the input specification that specifies the finite response property may not hold.
WARNING: Before generating PLC code, the bounded response, confluence and non-blocking under control properties of the CIF specification should hold.
WARNING: Please improve the CIF specification, and check the properties again.
WARNING:
WARNING: Using control code generated from a CIF specification without bounded response, confluence or non-blocking under control properties may result in undesired or unexpected behavior of the controlled system.
WARNING: Used uncontrollable event iteration limit (at most 3 attempts) is less than the bounded response limit of the controller properties annotation (5 attempts are needed).
WARNING: Using a lower limit than the bound of the controller properties annotation in the specification may result in undesired or unexpected behavior of the controlled system.
WARNING: I/O table file "plcgen/option_max_iter_3_resp.csv" not found. The PLC code will not perform any I/O with the environment.
