WARNING: The Input specification has no annotation for the bounded response property.
WARNING: The Input specification has no annotation for the confluence property.
WARNING: Before generating PLC code, both the bounded response and the confluence properties of the CIF specificiation should be checked and hold.
WARNING: Please apply the CIF controller properties checker application on hte CIF specification before generating PLC code from it.
WARNING:
WARNING: Using control code generated from a CIF specification without both bounded response and confluence properties may result in undesired or unexpected behavior of the controlled system.
WARNING: Bounded response limit for uncontrollable events is not available, falling back to limitless trying events until blocked.
WARNING: Bounded response limit for controllable events is not available, falling back to limitless trying events until blocked.
WARNING: Maximum real type size supported by the PLC is less than the CIF real type size. Some values in the program may be truncated.
WARNING: I/O table file "plcgen/empty_edges.csv" not found. The PLC code will not perform any I/O with the environment.
