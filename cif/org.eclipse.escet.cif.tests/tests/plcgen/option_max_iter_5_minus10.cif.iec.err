WARNING: The Input specification has no annotation for the bounded response property.
WARNING: The Input specification has no annotation for the confluence property.
WARNING: Before generating PLC code, both the bounded response and the confluence properties of the CIF specificiation should be checked and hold.
WARNING: Please apply the CIF controller properties checker application on hte CIF specification before generating PLC code from it.
WARNING:
WARNING: Using control code generated from a CIF specification without both bounded response and confluence properties may result in undesired or unexpected behavior of the controlled system.
ERROR: PLC maximum iterations option value "-10" for controllable events is not a positive number.
