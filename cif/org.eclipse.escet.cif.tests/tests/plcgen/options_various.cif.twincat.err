WARNING: The input specification has no controller properties annotation that specifies the bounded response property.
WARNING: The input specification has no controller properties annotation that specifies the confluence property.
WARNING: The input specification has no controller properties annotation that specifies the non-blocking under control property.
WARNING: Before generating PLC code, the bounded response, confluence and non-blocking under control properties of the CIF specification should be checked and should hold.
WARNING: Please apply the CIF controller properties checker application on the CIF specification before generating PLC code from it.
WARNING:
WARNING: Using control code generated from a CIF specification without bounded response, confluence or non-blocking under control properties may result in undesired or unexpected behavior of the controlled system.
WARNING: Configured real type size is less than the CIF real type size. Some values in the program may be truncated.
WARNING: I/O table file "plcgen/options_various.csv" not found. The PLC code will not perform any I/O with the environment.
ERROR: TwinCAT output with periodic task scheduling disabled, is currently not supported.
