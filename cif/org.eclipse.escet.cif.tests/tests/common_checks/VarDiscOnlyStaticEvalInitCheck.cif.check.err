ERROR: CIF common checks tester failed due to unsatisfied preconditions:
 - Unsupported "A.v1": discrete variable's initial value cannot be evaluated statically, as the evaluation resulted in an evaluation error.
 - Unsupported "A.v2": discrete variable's 1st initial value cannot be evaluated statically, as the evaluation resulted in an evaluation error.
 - Unsupported "A.v2": discrete variable's 2nd initial value cannot be evaluated statically, as the evaluation resulted in an evaluation error.
