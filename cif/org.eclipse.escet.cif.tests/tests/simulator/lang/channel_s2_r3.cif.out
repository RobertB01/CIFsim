Initial state: time=0.0, r1=l1, r1.v=0, r2=l1, r2.v=0, r3=l1, r3.v=0, s1=l1, s1.v=1, s2=l1, s2.v=2

Possible transitions:
  #1: event e (communicates value 1)
  #2: event e (communicates value 1)
  #3: event e (communicates value 1)
  #4: event e (communicates value 2)
  #5: event e (communicates value 2)
  #6: event e (communicates value 2)

Transition: event e (communicates value 1)
State: time=0.0, r1=l2, r1.v=1, r2=l1, r2.v=0, r3=l1, r3.v=0, s1=l2, s1.v=1, s2=l1, s2.v=2

Possible transitions:
  #1: event e (communicates value 2)
  #2: event e (communicates value 2)

Transition: event e (communicates value 2)
State: time=0.0, r1=l2, r1.v=1, r2=l2, r2.v=2, r3=l1, r3.v=0, s1=l2, s1.v=1, s2=l2, s2.v=2

Simulation resulted in deadlock.
