Initial state: time=0.0, p1=*, p2=*, q1=l, q2=l, r1=l1, r2=l1

Possible transitions:
  #1: event f
  #2: event tau

Transition: event f
State: time=0.0, p1=*, p2=*, q1=l, q2=l, r1=l1, r2=l2

Transition: event tau
State: time=0.0, p1=*, p2=*, q1=l, q2=l, r1=l2, r2=l2

Simulation resulted in deadlock.
