Initial state: time=0.0, p=l1, p.x=0

Possible transitions:
  #1: event e1
  #2: event e2

Transition: event e1
State: time=0.0, p=l1, p.x=1

Transition: event e2
State: time=0.0, p=l2, p.x=1

Transition: event tau
State: time=0.0, p=l2, p.x=2

Transition: event tau
State: time=0.0, p=l2, p.x=3

Simulation resulted in deadlock.
