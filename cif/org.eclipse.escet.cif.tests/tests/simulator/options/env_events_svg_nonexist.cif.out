Initial state: time=0.0, a=l1, b=loc1

Possible transitions:
  #1: event e1
  #2: delay for (0 .. 10.0]

Transition: event e1
State: time=0.0, a=l1, b=loc2

Possible transitions:
  #1: event e2
  #2: delay for (0 .. 10.0]

Transition: event e2
State: time=0.0, a=l1, b=loc3

Transition: event e3
State: time=0.0, a=l1, b=loc4

Transition: event e4
State: time=0.0, a=l2, b=loc5

Simulation resulted in deadlock.
