Initial state: time=0.0, a=*, b=*, c=m1

Possible transitions:
  #1: event a.e
  #2: event b.e

Transition: event b.e
State: time=0.0, a=*, b=*, c=m2

Possible transitions:
  #1: event a.e
  #2: delay for (0 .. 10.0]

Transition: delaying for 10.0 time units at time 0.0
State: time=10.0, a=*, b=*, c=m2
