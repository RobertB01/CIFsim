Iteration 1.

The following events have initially been encountered in a forcible-event loop of automaton A
* (A.e A.g)
* (A.h A.m)
* (A.l A.k)
* (A.o)
* (A.a A.c A.i)

Warning: (A.e A.g) is not forcible-unconnectable
Warning: (A.h A.m) is not forcible-unconnectable
Warning: (A.l A.k) is not forcible-unconnectable
Warning: (A.o) is not forcible-unconnectable
Warning: (A.a A.c A.i) is not forcible-unconnectable
Iteration 2.

The following events have initially been encountered in a forcible-event loop of automaton A
* (A.a A.c A.i)
* (A.e A.g)
* (A.h A.m)
* (A.o)
* (A.k A.l)

Warning: (A.a A.c A.i) is not forcible-unconnectable
Warning: (A.e A.g) is not forcible-unconnectable
Warning: (A.h A.m) is not forcible-unconnectable
Warning: (A.o) is not forcible-unconnectable
Warning: (A.k A.l) is not forcible-unconnectable
The specification does not have finite response, at least one forcible-event loop was found.
The following events might still occur in a forcible loop.
A.a, 
A.c, 
A.e, 
A.g, 
A.h, 
A.i, 
A.k, 
A.l,
