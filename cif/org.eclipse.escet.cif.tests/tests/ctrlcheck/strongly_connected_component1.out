Iteration 1.
    The following events have initially been encountered in a controllable-event loop of automaton A:
        * (A.e A.g)
        * (A.h A.m)
        * (A.l A.k)
        * (A.o)
        * (A.a A.c A.i)
    
    (A.e A.g) is not controllabe unconnectable
    (A.h A.m) is not controllabe unconnectable
    (A.l A.k) is not controllabe unconnectable
    (A.o) is not controllabe unconnectable
    (A.a A.c A.i) is not controllabe unconnectable
Iteration 2.
    The following events have initially been encountered in a controllable-event loop of automaton A:
        * (A.a A.c A.i)
        * (A.e A.g)
        * (A.h A.m)
        * (A.o)
        * (A.k A.l)
    
    (A.a A.c A.i) is not controllabe unconnectable
    (A.e A.g) is not controllabe unconnectable
    (A.h A.m) is not controllabe unconnectable
    (A.o) is not controllabe unconnectable
    (A.k A.l) is not controllabe unconnectable

    CONCLUSION:
    ERROR, the specification does NOT have finite response.
    
    At least one controllable event loop was found.
    The following events might still occur in a controllable loop:
        - A.a
        - A.c
        - A.e
        - A.g
        - A.h
        - A.i
        - A.k
        - A.l
        - A.m
        - A.o
