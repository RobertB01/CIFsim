Checking for finite response...
Iteration 1.
    The following events have initially been encountered in a controllable-event loop of automaton Actuator:
        * (Actuator.c_on Actuator.c_off)
    
    (Actuator.c_on Actuator.c_off) is not controllabe unconnectable
    The following events have initially been encountered in a controllable-event loop of automaton RequirementStateEvtExcls:
        * (Actuator.c_on)
        * (Actuator.c_off)
    
    (Actuator.c_on) is not controllabe unconnectable
    (Actuator.c_off) is not controllabe unconnectable

    CONCLUSION:
    ERROR, the specification does NOT have finite response.
    
    At least one controllable event loop was found.
    The following events might still occur in a controllable loop:
        - Actuator.c_on
        - Actuator.c_off
