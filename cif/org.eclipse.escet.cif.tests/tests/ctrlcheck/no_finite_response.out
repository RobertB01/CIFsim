Checking for finite response...

Iteration 1.
    The following events have been encountered in a controllable-event loop of automaton Actuator:
        (Actuator.c_on Actuator.c_off), which is not controllable unconnectable.
    The following events have been encountered in a controllable-event loop of automaton RequirementStateEvtExcls:
        (Actuator.c_on), which is not controllable unconnectable.
        (Actuator.c_off), which is not controllable unconnectable.

CONCLUSION:
    ERROR, the specification does NOT have finite response.
    
    At least one controllable-event loop was found.
    The following events might still occur in a controllable-event loop:
        - Actuator.c_on
        - Actuator.c_off
