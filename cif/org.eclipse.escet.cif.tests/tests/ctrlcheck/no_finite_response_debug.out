The following events have initially been encountered in a forcible-event loop of automaton Actuator
* (Actuator.c_on Actuator.c_off)

Warning: (Actuator.c_on Actuator.c_off) is not forcible-unconnectable

The following events have initially been encountered in a forcible-event loop of automaton RequirementStateEvtExcls

* (Actuator.c_off)

Warning: (Actuator.c_on) is not forcible-unconnectable
Warning: (Actuator.c_off) is not forcible-unconnectable
The specification does not have finite response, at least one forcible-event loop was found.
The following events might still occur in a forcible loop.
Actuator.c_on, 
Actuator.c_off,
