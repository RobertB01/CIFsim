Iteration 1.
    The following events have initially been encountered in a controllable-event loop of automaton Actuator2:
        * (Actuator2.c_on Actuator2.c_off)
    
    (Actuator2.c_on Actuator2.c_off) is not controllabe unconnectable
    The following events have initially been encountered in a controllable-event loop of automaton Actuator1:
        * (Actuator1.c_on Actuator1.c_off)
    
    (Actuator1.c_on Actuator1.c_off) is controllable unconnectable
    The following events have initially been encountered in a controllable-event loop of automaton RequirementStateEvtExcls:
        * (Actuator2.c_on)
        * (Actuator2.c_off)
    
    (Actuator2.c_on) is not controllabe unconnectable
    (Actuator2.c_off) is not controllabe unconnectable
Iteration 2.
    The following events have initially been encountered in a controllable-event loop of automaton Actuator2:
        * (Actuator2.c_on Actuator2.c_off)
    
    (Actuator2.c_on Actuator2.c_off) is controllable unconnectable

    CONCLUSION:
    The specification has finite response.
