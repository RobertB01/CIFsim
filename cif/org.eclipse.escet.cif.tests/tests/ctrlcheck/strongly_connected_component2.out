Iteration 1.

The following events have initially been encountered in a forcible-event loop of automaton A
* (A.e A.k)
* (A.o A.m)
* (A.n A.q A.p)
* (A.r A.s A.t)
* (A.c A.f A.h)
* (A.d A.h)

Warning: (A.e A.k) is not forcible-unconnectable
Warning: (A.o A.m) is not forcible-unconnectable
Warning: (A.n A.q A.p) is not forcible-unconnectable
Warning: (A.r A.s A.t) is not forcible-unconnectable
Warning: (A.c A.f A.h) is not forcible-unconnectable
Warning: (A.d A.h) is not forcible-unconnectable
Iteration 2.
