Iteration 2.
    The following events have initially been encountered in a controllable-event loop of automaton Aut1:
        * (Aut1.c_a Aut1.c_b)
    
    (Aut1.c_a Aut1.c_b) is not controllabe unconnectable

    CONCLUSION:
    ERROR, the specification does NOT have finite response.
    
    At least one controllable event loop was found.
    The following events might still occur in a controllable loop:
        - Aut1.c_a
        - Aut1.c_b
        - Aut4.c_a
        - Aut4.c_b
