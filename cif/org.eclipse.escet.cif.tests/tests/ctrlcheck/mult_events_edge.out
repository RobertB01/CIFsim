Checking for finite response...
Iteration 1.
    The following events have initially been encountered in a controllable-event loop of automaton A:
        * (A.a A.c A.e)
        * (A.a A.d A.e)
        * (A.b A.c A.e)
        * (A.b A.d A.e)
    
    (A.a A.c A.e) is not controllabe unconnectable
    (A.a A.d A.e) is not controllabe unconnectable
    (A.b A.c A.e) is not controllabe unconnectable
    (A.b A.d A.e) is not controllabe unconnectable

    CONCLUSION:
    ERROR, the specification does NOT have finite response.
    
    At least one controllable event loop was found.
    The following events might still occur in a controllable loop:
        - A.a
        - A.b
        - A.c
        - A.d
        - A.e
