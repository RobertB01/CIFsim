Checking for finite response...

Iteration 1.
    The following events have been encountered in a controllable-event loop of automaton A:
        (A.a A.c A.e), which is not controllable unconnectable.
        (A.a A.d A.e), which is not controllable unconnectable.
        (A.b A.c A.e), which is not controllable unconnectable.
        (A.b A.d A.e), which is not controllable unconnectable.

CONCLUSION:
    ERROR, the specification does NOT have finite response.
    
    At least one controllable-event loop was found.
    The following events might still occur in a controllable-event loop:
        - A.a
        - A.b
        - A.c
        - A.d
        - A.e
