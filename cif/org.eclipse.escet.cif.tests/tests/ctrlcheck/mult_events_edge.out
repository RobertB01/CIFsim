Iteration 1.

The following events have initially been encountered in a forcible-event loop of automaton A
* (A.a A.c A.e)
* (A.a A.d A.e)
* (A.b A.c A.e)
* (A.b A.d A.e)

Warning: (A.a A.c A.e) is not forcible-unconnectable
Warning: (A.a A.d A.e) is not forcible-unconnectable
Warning: (A.b A.c A.e) is not forcible-unconnectable
Warning: (A.b A.d A.e) is not forcible-unconnectable
The specification does not have finite response, at least one forcible-event loop was found.
The following events might still occur in a forcible loop.
A.a, 
A.b, 
A.c, 
A.d, 
A.e,
