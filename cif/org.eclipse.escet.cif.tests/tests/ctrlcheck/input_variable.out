Checking for finite response...
Iteration 1.
    The following events have initially been encountered in a controllable-event loop of automaton Actuator:
        * (Actuator.c_on Actuator.c_off)
    
    (Actuator.c_on Actuator.c_off) is controllable unconnectable

    CONCLUSION:
    The specification has finite response.
