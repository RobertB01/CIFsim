    Computing the bad states...
    Bad states: true [not controllable-complete path states predicate]

CONCLUSION:
    [UNKNOWN] Bounded response checking was disabled, bounded response property is unknown.
    [ERROR] The specification is NOT non-blocking under control.
    [UNKNOWN] Finite response checking was disabled, finite response property is unknown.
    [UNKNOWN] Confluence checking was disabled, confluence property is unknown.

The model with the check results has been written to "controllercheck/common/svg_input_decl_removed.xxxN.out.cif.real".
