Loading CIF specification "controllercheck/common/empty_alphabet.cif".
Preparing for BDD-based checks:
    The specification has no BDD variables.

    Restricting system behavior using state/event exclusion plant invariants:
        No guards changed.

Checking for non-blocking under control:
    Computing the condition for no controllable event to be enabled:
        Condition under which no controllable event is enabled: true

    Computing the controllable-complete path states:
        Controllable-complete path states: true [controllable-complete path end states predicate]

        Controllable-complete path states: true

    Computing the bad states:
        Bad states: false [not controllable-complete path states predicate]

        Bad states: false

    Computing the result of the non-blocking under control check:
        Initial states: true
        Bad initial states: false

    Non-blocking under control: yes

CONCLUSION:
    [UNKNOWN] Bounded response checking was disabled, bounded response property is unknown.
    [OK] The specification is non-blocking under control.
    [UNKNOWN] Finite response checking was disabled, finite response property is unknown.
    [UNKNOWN] Confluence checking was disabled, confluence property is unknown.

The model with the check results has been written to "controllercheck/common/empty_alphabet.xxxN.out.cif.real".
