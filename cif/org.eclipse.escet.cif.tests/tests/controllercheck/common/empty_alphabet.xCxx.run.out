Loading CIF specification "controllercheck/common/empty_alphabet.cif".
Preparing for MDD-based checks:
    Analyzing automaton "p":
        Nothing to process.

Checking for confluence:
    No controllable events. Confluence trivially holds.

CONCLUSION:
    [UNKNOWN] Bounded response checking was disabled, bounded response property is unknown.
    [UNKNOWN] Non-blocking under control checking was disabled, non-blocking under control property is unknown.
    [UNKNOWN] Finite response checking was disabled, finite response property is unknown.
    [OK] The specification has confluence.

The model with the check results has been written to "controllercheck/common/empty_alphabet.xCxx.out.cif.real".
