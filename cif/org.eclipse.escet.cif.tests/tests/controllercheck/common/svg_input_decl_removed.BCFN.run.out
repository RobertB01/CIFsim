Checking for bounded response...
    Computing reachable states:

Checking for non-blocking under control...
    Computing the condition for no controllable event to be enabled:
        Condition under which no controllable event is enabled: false

    Computing the controllable-complete path states...
        Controllable-complete path states: false [controllable-complete path end states predicate]

        Backward reachability iteration 1:
            No change this iteration.

        Controllable-complete path states: false

    Computing the bad states...
        Bad states: true [not controllable-complete path states predicate]

        Backward reachability iteration 1:
            No change this iteration.

        Bad states: true

    Computing the result of the non-blocking under control check...
        Initial states: true
        Bad initial states: true

    Non-blocking under control: no

Checking for finite response...
    Iteration 1.
        The following events have been encountered in a controllable-event loop of automaton p:
            (p.c), which is not controllable unconnectable.

Checking for confluence...

CONCLUSION:
    [ERROR] The specification does NOT have bounded response:

        - An infinite sequence of transitions is possible for uncontrollable events.
        - An infinite sequence of transitions is possible for controllable events.

    [ERROR] The specification is NOT non-blocking under control.

    [ERROR] The specification may NOT have finite response:

        At least one controllable-event loop was found.
        The following events might still occur in a controllable-event loop:
            - p.c

    [OK] The specification has confluence.

The model with the check results has been written to "controllercheck/common/svg_input_decl_removed.BCFN.out.cif.real".
