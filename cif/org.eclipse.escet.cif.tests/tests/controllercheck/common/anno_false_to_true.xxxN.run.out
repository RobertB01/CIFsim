Checking for non-blocking under control...
    Computing the condition for no controllable event to be enabled...
    Condition under which no controllable event is enabled: not p.loc1

    Computing the controllable-complete path states...
    Controllable-complete path states: p.loc3 [controllable-complete path end states predicate]

    Backward reachability iteration 1:
        Controllable-complete path states: p.loc3 -> not p.loc1 [backward reach with edge: (event: u) (guard: p.loc2) (assignments: p := p.loc3)]

    Backward reachability iteration 2:
        Controllable-complete path states: not p.loc1 -> true [backward reach with edge: (event: c) (guard: p.loc1) (assignments: p := p.loc2)]

    Backward reachability iteration 3:
        No change this iteration.

    Controllable-complete path states: true [fixed point].
    Controllable-complete path states: true

    Computing the bad states...
    Bad states: false [not controllable-complete path states predicate]

    Backward reachability iteration 1:
        No change this iteration.
    Bad states: false

    Computing the result of the non-blocking under control check...
    Initial states: p.loc1
    Bad initial states: false

CONCLUSION:
    [UNKNOWN] Bounded response checking was disabled, bounded response property is unknown.
    [OK] The specification is non-blocking under control.
    [UNKNOWN] Finite response checking was disabled, finite response property is unknown.
    [UNKNOWN] Confluence checking was disabled, confluence property is unknown.

The model with the check results has been written to "controllercheck/common/anno_false_to_true.xxxN.out.cif.real".
