Checking for finite response...
    Iteration 1.
        The following events have been encountered in a controllable-event loop of automaton p:
            (c), which is not controllable unconnectable.

    Iteration 2.
        The following events have been encountered in a controllable-event loop of automaton p:
            (c), which is not controllable unconnectable.

Checking for confluence...
    Independent event pairs:
        (a, c), (b, c)

CONCLUSION:
    [ERROR] The specification does NOT have bounded response:

        - An infinite sequence of transitions is possible for uncontrollable events.
        - An infinite sequence of transitions is possible for controllable events.

    [ERROR] The specification is NOT non-blocking under control.

    [ERROR] The specification may NOT have finite response:

        At least one controllable-event loop was found.
        The following events might still occur in a controllable-event loop:
            - c

    [ERROR] The specification may NOT have confluence:

        Confluence of the following event pair could not be decided:
            (a, b)

The model with the check results has been written to "controllercheck/common/anno_true_to_false.BCFN.out.cif.real".
