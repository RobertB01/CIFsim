Loading CIF specification "controllercheck/common/anno_false_to_true.cif".
Preparing for MDD-based checks:
    Analyzing automaton "p":
        Initializing the automaton data for event "c".
        Processing edges from location "loc1" of automaton "p".
        Processing edges from location "loc2" of automaton "p".
        Processing edges from location "loc3" of automaton "p".
        Updating global guards and updates for event "c".

Checking for finite response:
    Iteration 1.

CONCLUSION:
    [UNKNOWN] Bounded response checking was disabled, bounded response property is unknown.
    [UNKNOWN] Non-blocking under control checking was disabled, non-blocking under control property is unknown.
    [OK] The specification has finite response.
    [UNKNOWN] Confluence checking was disabled, confluence property is unknown.

The model with the check results has been written to "controllercheck/common/anno_false_to_true.xxFx.out.cif.real".
