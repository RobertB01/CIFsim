    All pairs proven. Confluence holds.

CONCLUSION:
    [OK] The specification has bounded response:

        - A sequence of at most 1 transition is possible for uncontrollable events.
        - A sequence of at most 1 transition is possible for controllable events.

    [OK] The specification is non-blocking under control.
    [OK] The specification has finite response.
    [OK] The specification has confluence.

The model with the check results has been written to "controllercheck/common/anno_false_to_true.BCFN.out.cif.real".
