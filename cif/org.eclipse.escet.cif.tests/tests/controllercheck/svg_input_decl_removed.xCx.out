Checking for confluence...

CONCLUSION:
    [UNKNOWN] Bounded response checking was disabled, bounded response property is unknown.
    [UNKNOWN] Finite response checking was disabled, finite response property is unknown.
    [OK] The specification has confluence.

The model with the check results has been written to "controllercheck/svg_input_decl_removed.checked.cif".
