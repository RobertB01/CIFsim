CONCLUSION:
    ERROR, the specification may NOT have finite response.
    
    At least one controllable-event loop was found.
    The following events might still occur in a controllable-event loop:
        - Aut1.c_a
        - Aut1.c_b
        - Aut4.c_a
        - Aut4.c_b

    ERROR, the specification may NOT have confluence.
    
    The following event pairs failed all tests:
        (Aut1.c_a, Aut2.c_b), (Aut1.c_a, Aut4.c_b), (Aut1.c_a, Aut5.c_b), (Aut1.c_b, Aut3.c_a), (Aut1.c_b, Aut3.c_b), (Aut1.c_b, Aut4.c_a), (Aut1.c_b, Aut6.c_a), (Aut1.c_b, Aut6.c_b), (Aut2.c_b, Aut3.c_a), (Aut2.c_b, Aut3.c_b), (Aut2.c_b, Aut4.c_a), (Aut2.c_b, Aut6.c_a), (Aut2.c_b, Aut6.c_b), (Aut3.c_a, Aut4.c_b), (Aut3.c_a, Aut5.c_b), (Aut3.c_b, Aut4.c_b), (Aut3.c_b, Aut5.c_b), (Aut4.c_a, Aut5.c_b), (Aut4.c_b, Aut6.c_a), (Aut4.c_b, Aut6.c_b), (Aut5.c_b, Aut6.c_a), (Aut5.c_b, Aut6.c_b)
