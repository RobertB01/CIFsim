Checking for finite response...

Iteration 1.
    The following events have been encountered in a controllable-event loop of automaton Aut1:
        (Aut1.c_a Aut1.c_b), which is not controllable unconnectable.
    The following events have been encountered in a controllable-event loop of automaton Aut3:
        (Aut3.c_a Aut3.c_b), which is controllable unconnectable.
    The following events have been encountered in a controllable-event loop of automaton Aut4:
        (Aut4.c_a Aut4.c_b), which is not controllable unconnectable.
    The following events have been encountered in a controllable-event loop of automaton Aut6:
        (Aut6.c_a Aut6.c_b), which is controllable unconnectable.
    The following events have been encountered in a controllable-event loop of automaton SupervisorStateEvtExcls:
        (Aut1.c_a), which is not controllable unconnectable.
        (Aut4.c_a), which is not controllable unconnectable.

Iteration 2.
    The following events have been encountered in a controllable-event loop of automaton Aut1:
        (Aut1.c_a Aut1.c_b), which is not controllable unconnectable.
    The following events have been encountered in a controllable-event loop of automaton Aut4:
        (Aut4.c_a Aut4.c_b), which is not controllable unconnectable.
    The following events have been encountered in a controllable-event loop of automaton SupervisorStateEvtExcls:
        (Aut1.c_a), which is not controllable unconnectable.
        (Aut4.c_a), which is not controllable unconnectable.

CONCLUSION:
    [UNKNOWN] Bounded response checking was disabled, bounded response property is unknown.
    [UNKNOWN] Non-blocking under control checking was disabled, non-blocking under control property is unknown.

    [ERROR] The specification may NOT have finite response:

        At least one controllable-event loop was found.
        The following events might still occur in a controllable-event loop:
            - Aut1.c_a
            - Aut1.c_b
            - Aut4.c_a
            - Aut4.c_b

    [UNKNOWN] Confluence checking was disabled, confluence property is unknown.

The model with the check results has been written to "controllercheck/finite_response/if_switch_expressions.xxFx.out.cif.real".
