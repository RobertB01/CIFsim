Loading CIF specification "controllercheck/finite_response/self_loop.cif".
Preparing for MDD-based checks:
    Analyzing automaton "test":
        Initializing the automaton data for event "test.c".
        Processing edges from the location of automaton "test".
        Updating global guards and updates for event "test.c".

Checking for finite response:
    Iteration 1.

CONCLUSION:
    [UNKNOWN] Bounded response checking was disabled, bounded response property is unknown.
    [UNKNOWN] Non-blocking under control checking was disabled, non-blocking under control property is unknown.
    [OK] The specification has finite response.
    [UNKNOWN] Confluence checking was disabled, confluence property is unknown.

The model with the check results has been written to "controllercheck/finite_response/self_loop.xxFx.out.cif.real".
