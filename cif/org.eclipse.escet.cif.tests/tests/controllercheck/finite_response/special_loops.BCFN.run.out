Checking for bounded response:
    Computing reachable states:
        Reachable states: A.l0 and B.l0 [initial states predicate]

        Reachable states: true [fixed point].

    Computing bound for uncontrollable events:
        Bounded response check round 1 (states before round: true).

        Bound: 0.

    Computing bound for controllable events:
        Bounded response check round 1 (states before round: true).

        Bound: n/a (cycle).

    Bounded response check completed.

Checking for non-blocking under control:
    Computing the condition for no controllable event to be enabled:
        Condition under which no controllable event is enabled: false

    Computing the controllable-complete path states:
        Controllable-complete path states: false [controllable-complete path end states predicate]

        Controllable-complete path states: false

    Computing the bad states:
        Bad states: true [not controllable-complete path states predicate]

        Bad states: true

    Computing the result of the non-blocking under control check:
        Initial states: A.l0 and B.l0
        Bad initial states: A.l0 and B.l0

    Non-blocking under control: no

Checking for finite response:
    Iteration 1.
        The following events have been encountered in a controllable-event loop of automaton A:
            (A.a A.b), which is not controllable unconnectable.
        The following events have been encountered in a controllable-event loop of automaton B:
            (B.a B.a), which is not controllable unconnectable.

Checking for confluence:
    Independent event pairs:
        (A.a, B.a), (A.b, B.a)

    Some pairs unproven. Confluence may not hold.

CONCLUSION:
    [ERROR] The specification does NOT have bounded response:

        - No transitions are possible for uncontrollable events.
        - An infinite sequence of transitions is possible for controllable events.

    [ERROR] The specification is NOT non-blocking under control.

    [ERROR] The specification may NOT have finite response:

        At least one controllable-event loop was found.
        The following events might still occur in a controllable-event loop:
            - A.a
            - A.b
            - B.a

    [ERROR] The specification may NOT have confluence:

        Confluence of the following event pair could not be decided:
            (A.a, A.b)
