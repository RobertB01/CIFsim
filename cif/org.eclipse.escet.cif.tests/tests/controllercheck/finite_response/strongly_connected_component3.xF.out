        (A.c A.f A.h), which is not controllable unconnectable.
        (A.d A.h), which is not controllable unconnectable.
        (A.r A.s A.t), which is not controllable unconnectable.

CONCLUSION:
    [ERROR] The specification may NOT have finite response.
    
        At least one controllable-event loop was found.
        The following events might still occur in a controllable-event loop:
            - A.c
            - A.d
            - A.e
            - A.f
            - A.h
            - A.k
            - A.m
            - A.o
            - A.r
            - A.s
            - A.t

    [ERROR] The specification may NOT have confluence.
    
        Confluence of the following event pairs could not be decided:
            (A.b, A.c), (A.b, A.d), (A.c, A.d), (A.f, A.g), (A.h, A.i), (A.h, A.j), (A.i, A.j), (A.k, A.l), (A.q, A.r)
