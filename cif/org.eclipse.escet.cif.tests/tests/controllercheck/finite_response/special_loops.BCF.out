Computing bound for controllable events...
Bounded response check round 1 (states before round: true).

Bounded response check completed.

Checking for finite response...

Iteration 1.
    The following events have been encountered in a controllable-event loop of automaton A:
        (A.a A.b), which is not controllable unconnectable.
    The following events have been encountered in a controllable-event loop of automaton B:
        (B.a B.a), which is not controllable unconnectable.

Checking for confluence...

Independent event pairs:
    (A.a, B.a), (A.b, B.a)

CONCLUSION:
    [ERROR] The specification does NOT have bounded response.
    
        [OK] No transitions are possible for uncontrollable events.
        [ERROR] An infinite sequence of transitions is possible for controllable events.

    [ERROR] The specification may NOT have finite response.
    
        At least one controllable-event loop was found.
        The following events might still occur in a controllable-event loop:
            - A.a
            - A.b
            - B.a

    [ERROR] The specification may NOT have confluence.
    
        Confluence of the following event pair could not be decided:
            (A.a, A.b)
