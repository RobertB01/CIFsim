Restricting system behavior using state/event exclusion plant invariants.

Edge (event: X.a) (guard: X.A) (assignments: X := X.B): guard: X.A -> X.A and Y != 1 [plant: Y != 1].
Edge (event: X.b) (guard: X.B) (assignments: X := X.C): guard: X.B -> X.B and Y != 2 [plant: Y != 2].
Edge (event: X.c) (guard: X.C) (assignments: X := X.A): guard: X.C -> X.C and Y = 2 or X.C and Y = 1 [plant: Y != 0].

System:
    Edge: (event: X.a) (guard: X.A -> X.A and Y != 1) (assignments: X := X.B)
    Edge: (event: X.b) (guard: X.B -> X.B and Y != 2) (assignments: X := X.C)
    Edge: (event: X.c) (guard: X.C -> X.C and Y = 2 or X.C and Y = 1) (assignments: X := X.A)

Checking for bounded response...
Computing reachable states...
Reachable states: X.A [initial states predicate]
Forward reachability: iteration 1.
Reachable states: X.A -> X.A or X.B and Y != 1 [forward reach with edge: (event: X.a) (guard: X.A -> X.A and Y != 1) (assignments: X := X.B)]
Reachable states: X.A or X.B and Y != 1 -> X.A or (X.C and Y = 0 or X.B and Y != 1) [forward reach with edge: (event: X.b) (guard: X.B -> X.B and Y != 2) (assignments: X := X.C)]

Forward reachability: iteration 2.
Reachable states: true [fixed point].

Computing bound for uncontrollable events...
Bounded response check round 1 (states before round: true).

Computing bound for controllable events...
Bounded response check round 1 (states before round: true).
Bounded response check round 2 (states before round: (not X.A or Y != 0) and ((not X.C or Y != 2) and (not X.B or Y != 1))).
Bounded response check round 3 (states before round: X.A and Y = 1 or (X.C and Y = 0 or X.B and Y = 2)).

Bounded response check completed.

Checking for finite response...

Iteration 1.
    The following events have been encountered in a controllable-event loop of automaton X:
        (X.a X.b X.c), which is controllable unconnectable.

Checking for confluence...

Mutual exclusive event pairs:
    (X.a, X.b), (X.a, X.c), (X.b, X.c)

CONCLUSION:
    [OK] The specification has bounded response:
    
        - No transitions are possible for uncontrollable events.
        - A sequence of at most 2 transitions is possible for controllable events.

    [OK] The specification has finite response.
    [OK] The specification has confluence.
