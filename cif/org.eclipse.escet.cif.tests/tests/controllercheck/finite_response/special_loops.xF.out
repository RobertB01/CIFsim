Checking for finite response...

Iteration 1.
    The following events have been encountered in a controllable-event loop of automaton A:
        (A.a A.b), which is not controllable unconnectable.
    The following events have been encountered in a controllable-event loop of automaton B:
        (B.a B.a), which is not controllable unconnectable.

CONCLUSION:
    [ERROR] The specification may NOT have finite response.
    
        At least one controllable-event loop was found.
        The following events might still occur in a controllable-event loop:
            - A.a
            - A.b
            - B.a

    Confluence checking was disabled, confluence property is unknown.
