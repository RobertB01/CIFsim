Loading CIF specification "controllercheck/finite_response/self_loop.cif"...
Prepare for the checks...
Analyzing automaton "test"...
    Initialize the automaton data for event "test.c"...
    Process edges from location "the location of automaton "test""...
    Update global guards and updates for event "test.c"...
Checking for finite response...

Iteration 1.

Checking for confluence...

CONCLUSION:
    [OK] The specification has finite response.
    [OK] The specification has confluence.
