Checking for bounded response...
Computing reachable states...
Reachable states: A.l0 [initial states predicate]
Forward reachability: iteration 1.
Reachable states: A.l0 -> not A.l2 [forward reach with edge: (event: A.a) (guard: A.l0) (assignments: A := A.l1)]
Reachable states: not A.l2 -> true [forward reach with edge: (event: A.c) (guard: A.l1) (assignments: A := A.l2)]
Forward reachability: iteration 2.
Reachable states: true [fixed point].

Computing bound for uncontrollable events...
Bounded response check round 1 (states before round: true).
Bounded response check round 2 (states before round: A.l0).

Computing bound for controllable events...
Bounded response check round 1 (states before round: true).

Bounded response check completed.

Checking for finite response...

Iteration 1.
    The following events have been encountered in a controllable-event loop of automaton A:
        (A.a A.c A.e), which is not controllable unconnectable.
        (A.a A.d A.e), which is not controllable unconnectable.
        (A.b A.c A.e), which is not controllable unconnectable.
        (A.b A.d A.e), which is not controllable unconnectable.

Checking for confluence...

Mutual exclusive event pairs:
    (A.a, A.c), (A.a, A.d), (A.a, A.e), (A.b, A.c), (A.b, A.d), (A.b, A.e), (A.c, A.e), (A.d, A.e)

Update equivalent event pairs:
    (A.a, A.b), (A.c, A.d)

CONCLUSION:
    [ERROR] The specification does NOT have bounded response:
    
        - A sequence of at most 1 transition is possible for uncontrollable events.
        - An infinite sequence of transitions is possible for controllable events.

    [UNKNOWN] Non-blocking under control checking was disabled, non-blocking under control property is unknown.

    [ERROR] The specification may NOT have finite response:
    
        At least one controllable-event loop was found.
        The following events might still occur in a controllable-event loop:
            - A.a
            - A.b
            - A.c
            - A.d
            - A.e

    [OK] The specification has confluence.

The model with the check results has been written to "controllercheck/finite_response/mult_events_edge.BCF.out.cif.real".
