Checking for bounded response:
    Computing reachable states:
        Reachable states: A.l0 [initial states predicate]

        Forward reachability iteration 1:
            Reachable states: A.l0 -> not A.l2 [forward reach with edge: (event: A.a) (guard: A.l0) (assignments: A := A.l1)]
            Reachable states: not A.l2 -> true [forward reach with edge: (event: A.c) (guard: A.l1) (assignments: A := A.l2)]

        Forward reachability iteration 2:
            No change this iteration.

        Reachable states: true [fixed point].

    Computing bound for uncontrollable events:
        Bounded response check round 1 (states before round: true).
        Bounded response check round 2 (states before round: A.l0).

        Bound: 1.

    Computing bound for controllable events:
        Bounded response check round 1 (states before round: true).

        Bound: n/a (cycle).

    Bounded response check completed.

Checking for non-blocking under control:
    Computing the condition for no controllable event to be enabled:
        Condition under which no controllable event is enabled: false

    Computing the controllable-complete path states:
        Controllable-complete path states: false [controllable-complete path end states predicate]

        Backward reachability iteration 1:
            No change this iteration.

        Controllable-complete path states: false

    Computing the bad states:
        Bad states: true [not controllable-complete path states predicate]

        Backward reachability iteration 1:
            No change this iteration.

        Bad states: true

    Computing the result of the non-blocking under control check:
        Initial states: A.l0
        Bad initial states: A.l0

    Non-blocking under control: no

Checking for finite response:
    Iteration 1.
        The following events have been encountered in a controllable-event loop of automaton A:
            (A.a A.c A.e), which is not controllable unconnectable.
            (A.a A.d A.e), which is not controllable unconnectable.
            (A.b A.c A.e), which is not controllable unconnectable.
            (A.b A.d A.e), which is not controllable unconnectable.

Checking for confluence:
    Mutual exclusive event pairs:
        (A.a, A.c), (A.a, A.d), (A.a, A.e), (A.b, A.c), (A.b, A.d), (A.b, A.e), (A.c, A.e), (A.d, A.e)

    Update equivalent event pairs:
        (A.a, A.b), (A.c, A.d)

    All pairs proven. Confluence holds.

CONCLUSION:
    [ERROR] The specification does NOT have bounded response:

        - A sequence of at most 1 transition is possible for uncontrollable events.
        - An infinite sequence of transitions is possible for controllable events.

    [ERROR] The specification is NOT non-blocking under control.

    [ERROR] The specification may NOT have finite response:

        At least one controllable-event loop was found.
        The following events might still occur in a controllable-event loop:
            - A.a
            - A.b
            - A.c
            - A.d
            - A.e

    [OK] The specification has confluence.

The model with the check results has been written to "controllercheck/finite_response/mult_events_edge.BCFN.out.cif.real".
