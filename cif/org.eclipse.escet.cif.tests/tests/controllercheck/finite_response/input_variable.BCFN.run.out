Checking for finite response:
    Iteration 1.
        The following events have been encountered in a controllable-event loop of automaton Actuator:
            (Actuator.c_on Actuator.c_off), which is controllable unconnectable.

Checking for confluence:
    Mutual exclusive event pairs:
        (Actuator.c_off, Actuator.c_on)

    All pairs proven. Confluence holds.

CONCLUSION:
    [OK] The specification has bounded response:

        - No transitions are possible for uncontrollable events.
        - A sequence of at most 1 transition is possible for controllable events.

    [ERROR] The specification is NOT non-blocking under control.
    [OK] The specification has finite response.
    [OK] The specification has confluence.

The model with the check results has been written to "controllercheck/finite_response/input_variable.BCFN.out.cif.real".
