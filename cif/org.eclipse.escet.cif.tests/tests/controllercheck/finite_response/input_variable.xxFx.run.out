Checking for finite response...
    Iteration 1.
        The following events have been encountered in a controllable-event loop of automaton Actuator:
            (Actuator.c_on Actuator.c_off), which is controllable unconnectable.

CONCLUSION:
    [UNKNOWN] Bounded response checking was disabled, bounded response property is unknown.
    [UNKNOWN] Non-blocking under control checking was disabled, non-blocking under control property is unknown.
    [OK] The specification has finite response.
    [UNKNOWN] Confluence checking was disabled, confluence property is unknown.

The model with the check results has been written to "controllercheck/finite_response/input_variable.xxFx.out.cif.real".
