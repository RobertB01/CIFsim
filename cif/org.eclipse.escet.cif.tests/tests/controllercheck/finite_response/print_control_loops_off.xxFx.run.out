Checking for finite response...

Iteration 1.
    The following events have been encountered in a controllable-event loop of automaton p:
        (p.c1 p.c2), which is not controllable unconnectable.

CONCLUSION:
    [UNKNOWN] Bounded response checking was disabled, bounded response property is unknown.
    [UNKNOWN] Non-blocking under control checking was disabled, non-blocking under control property is unknown.

    [ERROR] The specification may NOT have finite response:

        At least one controllable-event loop was found.

    [UNKNOWN] Confluence checking was disabled, confluence property is unknown.

The model with the check results has been written to "controllercheck/finite_response/print_control_loops_off.xxFx.out.cif.real".
