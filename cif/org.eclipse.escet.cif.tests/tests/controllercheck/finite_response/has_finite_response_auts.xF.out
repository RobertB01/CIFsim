Checking for finite response...

Iteration 1.
    The following events have been encountered in a controllable-event loop of automaton Actuator:
        (Actuator.c_on Actuator.c_off), which is controllable unconnectable.

CONCLUSION:
    [OK] The specification has finite response.
    Confluence checking was disabled, confluence property is unknown.
