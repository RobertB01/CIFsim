Checking for finite response...

Iteration 1.
    The following events have been encountered in a controllable-event loop of automaton Actuator2:
        (Actuator2.c_on Actuator2.c_off), which is not controllable unconnectable.
    The following events have been encountered in a controllable-event loop of automaton Actuator1:
        (Actuator1.c_on Actuator1.c_off), which is controllable unconnectable.
    The following events have been encountered in a controllable-event loop of automaton SupervisorStateEvtExcls:
        (Actuator2.c_on), which is not controllable unconnectable.
        (Actuator2.c_off), which is not controllable unconnectable.

Iteration 2.
    The following events have been encountered in a controllable-event loop of automaton Actuator2:
        (Actuator2.c_on Actuator2.c_off), which is controllable unconnectable.

Checking for confluence...

Mutual exclusive event pairs:
    (Actuator1.c_off, Actuator1.c_on), (Actuator1.c_off, Actuator2.c_off), (Actuator1.c_on, Actuator2.c_on), (Actuator2.c_off, Actuator2.c_on)

CONCLUSION:
    Bounded response checking was disabled, bounded response property is unknown.
    [OK] The specification has finite response.

    [ERROR] The specification may NOT have confluence.
    
        Confluence of the following event pairs could not be decided:
            (Actuator1.c_off, Actuator2.c_on), (Actuator1.c_on, Actuator2.c_off)
