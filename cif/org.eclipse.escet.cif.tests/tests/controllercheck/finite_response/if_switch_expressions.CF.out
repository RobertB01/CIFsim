Checking for confluence...

Mutual exclusive event pairs:
    (Aut1.c_a, Aut1.c_b), (Aut1.c_a, Aut2.c_a), (Aut1.c_a, Aut5.c_a), (Aut1.c_b, Aut2.c_a), (Aut1.c_b, Aut5.c_a), (Aut2.c_a, Aut2.c_b), (Aut2.c_a, Aut3.c_a), (Aut2.c_a, Aut3.c_b), (Aut2.c_a, Aut4.c_a), (Aut2.c_a, Aut4.c_b), (Aut2.c_a, Aut5.c_a), (Aut2.c_a, Aut5.c_b), (Aut2.c_a, Aut6.c_a), (Aut2.c_a, Aut6.c_b), (Aut2.c_b, Aut5.c_a), (Aut3.c_a, Aut3.c_b), (Aut3.c_a, Aut5.c_a), (Aut3.c_a, Aut6.c_b), (Aut3.c_b, Aut5.c_a), (Aut3.c_b, Aut6.c_a), (Aut4.c_a, Aut4.c_b), (Aut4.c_a, Aut5.c_a), (Aut4.c_b, Aut5.c_a), (Aut5.c_a, Aut5.c_b), (Aut5.c_a, Aut6.c_a), (Aut5.c_a, Aut6.c_b), (Aut6.c_a, Aut6.c_b)

Independent event pairs:

CONCLUSION:
    [ERROR] The specification may NOT have finite response.
    
        At least one controllable-event loop was found.
        The following events might still occur in a controllable-event loop:
            - Aut1.c_a
            - Aut1.c_b
            - Aut4.c_a
            - Aut4.c_b

    [ERROR] The specification may NOT have confluence.
    
        Confluence of the following event pairs could not be decided:
            (Aut1.c_a, Aut2.c_b), (Aut1.c_a, Aut3.c_a), (Aut1.c_a, Aut3.c_b), (Aut1.c_a, Aut4.c_a), (Aut1.c_a, Aut4.c_b), (Aut1.c_a, Aut5.c_b), (Aut1.c_a, Aut6.c_a), (Aut1.c_a, Aut6.c_b), (Aut1.c_b, Aut3.c_a), (Aut1.c_b, Aut3.c_b), (Aut1.c_b, Aut4.c_a), (Aut1.c_b, Aut6.c_a), (Aut1.c_b, Aut6.c_b), (Aut2.c_b, Aut3.c_a), (Aut2.c_b, Aut3.c_b), (Aut2.c_b, Aut4.c_a), (Aut2.c_b, Aut6.c_a), (Aut2.c_b, Aut6.c_b), (Aut3.c_a, Aut4.c_a), (Aut3.c_a, Aut4.c_b), (Aut3.c_a, Aut5.c_b), (Aut3.c_a, Aut6.c_a), (Aut3.c_b, Aut4.c_a), (Aut3.c_b, Aut4.c_b), (Aut3.c_b, Aut5.c_b), (Aut3.c_b, Aut6.c_b), (Aut4.c_a, Aut5.c_b), (Aut4.c_a, Aut6.c_a), (Aut4.c_a, Aut6.c_b), (Aut4.c_b, Aut6.c_a), (Aut4.c_b, Aut6.c_b), (Aut5.c_b, Aut6.c_a), (Aut5.c_b, Aut6.c_b)
