Checking for finite response...

Iteration 1.
    The following events have been encountered in a controllable-event loop of automaton X:
        (X.a X.b X.c), which is controllable unconnectable.

CONCLUSION:
    [OK] The specification has finite response.
    Confluence checking was disabled, confluence property is unknown.
