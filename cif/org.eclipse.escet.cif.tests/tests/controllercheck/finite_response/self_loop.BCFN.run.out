Loading CIF specification "controllercheck/finite_response/self_loop.cif".
Preparing for BDD-based checks:
    The specification has no BDD variables.

    Restricting system behavior using state/event exclusion plant invariants:
        No guards changed.

Preparing for MDD-based checks:
    Analyzing automaton "test":
        Initializing the automaton data for event "test.c".
        Processing edges from the location of automaton "test".
        Updating global guards and updates for event "test.c".

Checking for bounded response:
    Computing reachable states:
        Reachable states: true [initial states predicate]

    Computing bound for uncontrollable events:
        Bounded response check round 1 (states before round: true).

        Bound: 0.

    Computing bound for controllable events:
        Bounded response check round 1 (states before round: true).

        Bound: 0.

    Bounded response check completed.

Checking for non-blocking under control:
    Computing the condition for no controllable event to be enabled:
        Condition under which no controllable event is enabled: true

    Computing the controllable-complete path states:
        Controllable-complete path states: false [controllable-complete path end states predicate]

        Controllable-complete path states: false

    Computing the bad states:
        Bad states: true [not controllable-complete path states predicate]

        Bad states: true

    Computing the result of the non-blocking under control check:
        Initial states: true
        Bad initial states: true

    Non-blocking under control: no

Checking for finite response:
    Iteration 1.

Checking for confluence:
    No proven pairs.

    All pairs proven. Confluence holds.

CONCLUSION:
    [OK] The specification has bounded response:

        - No transitions are possible for uncontrollable events.
        - No transitions are possible for controllable events.

    [ERROR] The specification is NOT non-blocking under control.
    [OK] The specification has finite response.
    [OK] The specification has confluence.

The model with the check results has been written to "controllercheck/finite_response/self_loop.BCFN.out.cif.real".
