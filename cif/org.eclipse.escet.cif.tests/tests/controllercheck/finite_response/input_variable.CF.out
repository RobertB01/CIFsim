Checking for finite response...

Iteration 1.
    The following events have been encountered in a controllable-event loop of automaton Actuator:
        (Actuator.c_on Actuator.c_off), which is controllable unconnectable.

Checking for confluence...

Mutual exclusive event pairs:
    (Actuator.c_off, Actuator.c_on)

CONCLUSION:
    [OK] The specification has finite response.
    [OK] The specification has confluence.
