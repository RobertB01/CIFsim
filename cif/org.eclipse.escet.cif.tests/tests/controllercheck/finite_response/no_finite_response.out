Checking for finite response...

Iteration 1.
    The following events have been encountered in a controllable-event loop of automaton Actuator:
        (Actuator.c_on Actuator.c_off), which is not controllable unconnectable.
    The following events have been encountered in a controllable-event loop of automaton RequirementStateEvtExcls:
        (Actuator.c_on), which is not controllable unconnectable.
        (Actuator.c_off), which is not controllable unconnectable.

Checking for confluence...

Mutual exclusive event pairs:
    (Actuator.c_off, Actuator.c_on)

CONCLUSION:
    [ERROR] The specification may NOT have finite response.
    
        At least one controllable-event loop was found.
        The following events might still occur in a controllable-event loop:
            - Actuator.c_off
            - Actuator.c_on

    [OK] The specification has confluence.
