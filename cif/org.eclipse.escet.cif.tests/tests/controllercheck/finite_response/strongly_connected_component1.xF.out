Checking for finite response...

Iteration 1.
    The following events have been encountered in a controllable-event loop of automaton A:
        (A.e A.g), which is not controllable unconnectable.
        (A.h A.m), which is not controllable unconnectable.
        (A.l A.k), which is not controllable unconnectable.
        (A.o), which is not controllable unconnectable.
        (A.a A.c A.i), which is not controllable unconnectable.

Iteration 2.
    The following events have been encountered in a controllable-event loop of automaton A:
        (A.a A.c A.i), which is not controllable unconnectable.
        (A.e A.g), which is not controllable unconnectable.
        (A.h A.m), which is not controllable unconnectable.
        (A.o), which is not controllable unconnectable.
        (A.k A.l), which is not controllable unconnectable.

CONCLUSION:
    [ERROR] The specification may NOT have finite response.
    
        At least one controllable-event loop was found.
        The following events might still occur in a controllable-event loop:
            - A.a
            - A.c
            - A.e
            - A.g
            - A.h
            - A.i
            - A.k
            - A.l
            - A.m
            - A.o

    Confluence checking was disabled, confluence property is unknown.
