CONCLUSION:
    [ERROR] The specification does NOT have bounded response:

        - A sequence of at most 1 transition is possible for uncontrollable events.
        - An infinite sequence of transitions is possible for controllable events.

    [ERROR] The specification is NOT non-blocking under control.

    [ERROR] The specification may NOT have finite response:

        At least one controllable-event loop was found.
        The following events might still occur in a controllable-event loop:
            - A.c
            - A.d
            - A.e
            - A.f

            - A.r
            - A.s
            - A.t

    [ERROR] The specification may NOT have confluence:

        Confluence of the following event pairs could not be decided:
            (A.b, A.c), (A.b, A.d), (A.c, A.d), (A.f, A.g), (A.h, A.i), (A.h, A.j), (A.i, A.j), (A.k, A.l), (A.q, A.r)
