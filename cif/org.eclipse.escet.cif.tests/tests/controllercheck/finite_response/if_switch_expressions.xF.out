Iteration 1.
    The following events have been encountered in a controllable-event loop of automaton Aut1:
        (Aut1.c_a Aut1.c_b), which is not controllable unconnectable.
    The following events have been encountered in a controllable-event loop of automaton Aut3:
        (Aut3.c_a Aut3.c_b), which is controllable unconnectable.
    The following events have been encountered in a controllable-event loop of automaton Aut4:
        (Aut4.c_a Aut4.c_b), which is not controllable unconnectable.
    The following events have been encountered in a controllable-event loop of automaton Aut6:
        (Aut6.c_a Aut6.c_b), which is controllable unconnectable.
    The following events have been encountered in a controllable-event loop of automaton RequirementStateEvtExcls:
        (Aut1.c_a), which is not controllable unconnectable.
        (Aut4.c_a), which is not controllable unconnectable.

Iteration 2.
    The following events have been encountered in a controllable-event loop of automaton Aut1:
        (Aut1.c_a Aut1.c_b), which is not controllable unconnectable.
    The following events have been encountered in a controllable-event loop of automaton Aut4:
        (Aut4.c_a Aut4.c_b), which is not controllable unconnectable.
    The following events have been encountered in a controllable-event loop of automaton RequirementStateEvtExcls:
        (Aut1.c_a), which is not controllable unconnectable.
        (Aut4.c_a), which is not controllable unconnectable.

CONCLUSION:
    [ERROR] The specification may NOT have finite response.
    
        At least one controllable-event loop was found.
        The following events might still occur in a controllable-event loop:
            - Aut1.c_a
            - Aut1.c_b
            - Aut4.c_a
            - Aut4.c_b

    Confluence checking was disabled, confluence property is unknown.
