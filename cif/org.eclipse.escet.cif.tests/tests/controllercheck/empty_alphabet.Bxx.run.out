Loading CIF specification "controllercheck/empty_alphabet.cif"...
Preparing for BDD-based checks...

Restricting system behavior using state/event exclusion plant invariants.

Checking for bounded response...
Computing reachable states...
Reachable states: true [initial states predicate]

Computing bound for uncontrollable events...
Bounded response check round 1 (states before round: true).

Computing bound for controllable events...
Bounded response check round 1 (states before round: true).

Bounded response check completed.

CONCLUSION:
    [OK] The specification has bounded response:
    
        - No transitions are possible for uncontrollable events.
        - No transitions are possible for controllable events.

    [UNKNOWN] Finite response checking was disabled, finite response property is unknown.
    [UNKNOWN] Confluence checking was disabled, confluence property is unknown.

The model with the check results has been written to "controllercheck/empty_alphabet.Bxx.out.cif.real".
