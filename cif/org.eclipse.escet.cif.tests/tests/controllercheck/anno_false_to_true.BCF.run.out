Checking for bounded response...
Computing reachable states...
Reachable states: p.loc1 [initial states predicate]
Forward reachability: iteration 1.
Reachable states: p.loc1 -> not p.loc3 [forward reach with edge: (event: c) (guard: p.loc1) (assignments: p := p.loc2)]
Reachable states: not p.loc3 -> true [forward reach with edge: (event: u) (guard: p.loc2) (assignments: p := p.loc3)]
Forward reachability: iteration 2.
Reachable states: true [fixed point].

Computing bound for uncontrollable events...
Bounded response check round 1 (states before round: true).
Bounded response check round 2 (states before round: p.loc3).

Computing bound for controllable events...
Bounded response check round 1 (states before round: true).
Bounded response check round 2 (states before round: p.loc2).

Bounded response check completed.

Checking for finite response...

Iteration 1.

Checking for confluence...

CONCLUSION:
    [OK] The specification has bounded response:
    
        - A sequence of at most 1 transition is possible for uncontrollable events.
        - A sequence of at most 1 transition is possible for controllable events.

    [OK] The specification has finite response.
    [OK] The specification has confluence.

The model with the check results has been written to "controllercheck/anno_false_to_true.BCF.out.cif.real".
