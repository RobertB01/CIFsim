Loading CIF specification "controllercheck/three_part_loop.cif"...
Checking for finite response...

Iteration 1.
    The following events have been encountered in a controllable-event loop of automaton X:
        (X.a X.b X.c), which is controllable unconnectable.

Checking for confluence...

Mutual exclusive event pairs:
    (X.a, X.b), (X.a, X.c), (X.b, X.c)

CONCLUSION:
    The specification has finite response.
    The specification has confluence.
