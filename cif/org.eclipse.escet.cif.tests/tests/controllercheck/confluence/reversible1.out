Loading CIF specification "controllercheck/confluence/reversible1.cif"...
Checking for finite response...

Iteration 1.
    The following events have been encountered in a controllable-event loop of automaton B:
        (b c), which is controllable unconnectable.

Checking for confluence...

Mutual exclusive event pairs:
    (a, c), (b, c)

Reversible event pairs:
    (a, b)

CONCLUSION:
    [OK] The specification has finite response.
    [OK] The specification has confluence.
