Checking for confluence...

CONCLUSION:
    [UNKNOWN] Bounded response checking was disabled, bounded response property is unknown.
    [UNKNOWN] Non-blocking under control checking was disabled, non-blocking under control property is unknown.
    [UNKNOWN] Finite response checking was disabled, finite response property is unknown.

    [ERROR] The specification may NOT have confluence:
    
        Confluence of the following event pair could not be decided:
            (SingleAut.a, SingleAut.b)

The model with the check results has been written to "controllercheck/confluence/not_confluent.xCxx.out.cif.real".
