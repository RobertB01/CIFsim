Loading CIF specification "controllercheck/confluence/mutual_exclusive2.cif"...
Prepare for the checks...
Analyzing automaton "DifferentConditions"...
    Initialize the automaton data for event "DifferentConditions.a"...
    Initialize the automaton data for event "DifferentConditions.b"...
    Process edges from location "location "p" of automaton "DifferentConditions""...
    Process edges from location "location "q" of automaton "DifferentConditions""...
    Update global guards and updates for event "DifferentConditions.a"...
    Update global guards and updates for event "DifferentConditions.b"...

Checking for confluence...

Mutual exclusive event pairs:
    (DifferentConditions.a, DifferentConditions.b)

CONCLUSION:
    Finite response checking was disabled, finite response property is unknown.
    [OK] The specification has confluence.
