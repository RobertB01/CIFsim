Checking for confluence...

Update equivalent event pairs:
    (SingleAut.a, SingleAut.b)

CONCLUSION:
    Bounded response checking was disabled, bounded response property is unknown.
    Finite response checking was disabled, finite response property is unknown.
    [OK] The specification has confluence.
