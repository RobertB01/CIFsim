Checking for bounded response...
Computing reachable states...
Reachable states: DifferentLocs.p [initial states predicate]
Forward reachability: iteration 1.
Reachable states: DifferentLocs.p -> not DifferentLocs.q [forward reach with edge: (event: DifferentLocs.a) (guard: DifferentLocs.p) (assignments: DifferentLocs := DifferentLocs.r)]
Reachable states: not DifferentLocs.q -> true [forward reach with edge: (event: DifferentLocs.u) (guard: DifferentLocs.p) (assignments: DifferentLocs := DifferentLocs.q)]
Forward reachability: iteration 2.
Reachable states: true [fixed point].

Computing bound for uncontrollable events...
Bounded response check round 1 (states before round: true).
Bounded response check round 2 (states before round: DifferentLocs.q).

Computing bound for controllable events...
Bounded response check round 1 (states before round: true).
Bounded response check round 2 (states before round: DifferentLocs.r).

Bounded response check completed.

Checking for finite response...

Iteration 1.

Checking for confluence...

Mutual exclusive event pairs:
    (DifferentLocs.a, DifferentLocs.b)

CONCLUSION:
    [OK] The specification has bounded response:
    
        - A sequence of at most 1 transition is possible for uncontrollable events.
        - A sequence of at most 1 transition is possible for controllable events.

    [OK] The specification has finite response.
    [OK] The specification has confluence.

The model with the check results has been written to "controllercheck/confluence/mutual_exclusive1.checked.cif".
