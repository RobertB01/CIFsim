Loading CIF specification "controllercheck/confluence/independence1.cif".
Preparing for MDD-based checks:
    Analyzing automaton "AutDifferenLocs":
        Initializing the automaton data for event "AutDifferenLocs.a".
        Initializing the automaton data for event "AutDifferenLocs.b".
        Processing edges from location "p" of automaton "AutDifferenLocs".
        Processing edges from location "q" of automaton "AutDifferenLocs".
        Processing edges from location "r" of automaton "AutDifferenLocs".
        Processing edges from location "s" of automaton "AutDifferenLocs".
        Updating global guards and updates for event "AutDifferenLocs.a".
        Updating global guards and updates for event "AutDifferenLocs.b".

Checking for confluence:
    Independent event pairs:
        (AutDifferenLocs.a, AutDifferenLocs.b)

    All pairs proven. Confluence holds.

CONCLUSION:
    [UNKNOWN] Bounded response checking was disabled, bounded response property is unknown.
    [UNKNOWN] Non-blocking under control checking was disabled, non-blocking under control property is unknown.
    [UNKNOWN] Finite response checking was disabled, finite response property is unknown.
    [OK] The specification has confluence.

The model with the check results has been written to "controllercheck/confluence/independence1.xCxx.out.cif.real".
