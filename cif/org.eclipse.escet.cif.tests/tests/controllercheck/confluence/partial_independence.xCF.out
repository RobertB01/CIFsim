Iteration 1.

Checking for confluence...

CONCLUSION:
    Bounded response checking was disabled, bounded response property is unknown.
    [OK] The specification has finite response.

    [ERROR] The specification may NOT have confluence.
    
        Confluence of the following event pair could not be decided:
            (A.a, A.b)
