Checking for confluence...

Mutual exclusive event pairs:
    (DifferentConditions.a, DifferentConditions.b)

CONCLUSION:
    [UNKNOWN] Bounded response checking was disabled, bounded response property is unknown.
    [UNKNOWN] Finite response checking was disabled, finite response property is unknown.
    [OK] The specification has confluence.

The model with the check results has been written to "controllercheck/confluence/mutual_exclusive2.checked.cif".
