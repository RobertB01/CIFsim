    Skipping variable ordering: only one variable present.

    Restricting system behavior using state/event exclusion plant invariants:
        No guards changed.

Preparing for MDD-based checks:
    Analyzing automaton "Supervisor2a":
        Initializing the automaton data for event "Supervisor2a.c_act1".
        Initializing the automaton data for event "Supervisor2a.c_act2".
        Processing edges from location "Start" of automaton "Supervisor2a".
        Processing edges from location "Done1" of automaton "Supervisor2a".
        Processing edges from location "BothDone" of automaton "Supervisor2a".
        Updating global guards and updates for event "Supervisor2a.c_act1".
        Updating global guards and updates for event "Supervisor2a.c_act2".

Checking for bounded response:
    Computing reachable states:
        Reachable states: Supervisor2a.Start [initial states predicate]

        Reachable states: true [fixed point].

    Computing bound for uncontrollable events:
        Bounded response check round 1 (states before round: true).
        Bounded response check round 2 (states before round: not Supervisor2a.BothDone).

        Bound: n/a (cycle).

    Computing bound for controllable events:
        Bounded response check round 1 (states before round: true).
        Bounded response check round 2 (states before round: not Supervisor2a.Start).
        Bounded response check round 3 (states before round: Supervisor2a.BothDone).

        Bound: 2.

    Bounded response check completed.

Checking for non-blocking under control:
    Computing the condition for no controllable event to be enabled:
        Condition under which no controllable event is enabled: Supervisor2a.BothDone

    Computing the controllable-complete path states:
        Controllable-complete path states: Supervisor2a.BothDone [controllable-complete path end states predicate]

        Controllable-complete path states: true [fixed point].

        Controllable-complete path states: true

    Computing the bad states:
        Bad states: false [not controllable-complete path states predicate]

        Bad states: false

    Computing the result of the non-blocking under control check:
        Initial states: Supervisor2a.Start
        Bad initial states: false

    Non-blocking under control: yes

Checking for finite response:
    Iteration 1.

Checking for confluence:
    Mutual exclusive event pairs:
        (Supervisor2a.c_act1, Supervisor2a.c_act2)

    All pairs proven. Confluence holds.

CONCLUSION:
    [ERROR] The specification does NOT have bounded response:

        - An infinite sequence of transitions is possible for uncontrollable events.
        - A sequence of at most 2 transitions is possible for controllable events.

    [OK] The specification is non-blocking under control.
    [OK] The specification has finite response.
    [OK] The specification has confluence.

The model with the check results has been written to "controllercheck/non_blocking_under_control/docs_example_2a.BCFN.out.cif.real".
