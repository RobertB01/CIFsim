Checking for non-blocking under control...
    Computing the condition for no controllable event to be enabled...
    Condition under which no controllable event is enabled: Supervisor.BothDone

    Computing the controllable-complete path states...
    Controllable-complete path states: Supervisor.BothDone [controllable-complete path end states predicate]

    Backward reachability iteration 1:
        Controllable-complete path states: Supervisor.BothDone -> not Supervisor.Start [backward reach with edge: (event: Supervisor.c_act2) (guard: Supervisor.Done1) (assignments: Supervisor := Supervisor.BothDone)]

    Backward reachability iteration 2:
        Controllable-complete path states: not Supervisor.Start -> true [backward reach with edge: (event: Supervisor.c_act1) (guard: Supervisor.Start) (assignments: Supervisor := Supervisor.Done1)]

    Backward reachability iteration 3:
        No change this iteration.

    Controllable-complete path states: true [fixed point].
    Controllable-complete path states: true

    Computing the bad states...
    Bad states: false [not controllable-complete path states predicate]

    Backward reachability iteration 1:
        No change this iteration.
    Bad states: false

    Computing the result of the non-blocking under control check...
    Initial states: Supervisor.Start
    Bad initial states: false

CONCLUSION:
    [UNKNOWN] Bounded response checking was disabled, bounded response property is unknown.
    [OK] The specification is non-blocking under control.
    [UNKNOWN] Finite response checking was disabled, finite response property is unknown.
    [UNKNOWN] Confluence checking was disabled, confluence property is unknown.

The model with the check results has been written to "controllercheck/non_blocking_under_control/nbuc_one_path.xxxN.out.cif.real".
