Condition under which no controllable event is enabled: Supervisor.BothDone

Computing the controllable-complete path states...
Controllable-complete path states: false [controllable-complete path end states predicate]
Backward reachability: iteration 1.
Controllable-complete path states: false

Computing the bad states...
Bad states: true [not controllable-complete path states predicate]
Backward reachability: iteration 1.
Bad states: true

Checking for finite response...

Iteration 1.

Checking for confluence...

Independent event pairs:
    (Supervisor.c_act1, Supervisor.c_act2)

CONCLUSION:
    [OK] The specification has bounded response:
    
        - A sequence of at most 1 transition is possible for uncontrollable events.
        - A sequence of at most 2 transitions is possible for controllable events.

    [ERROR] The specification is NOT non-blocking under control.
    [OK] The specification has finite response.
    [OK] The specification has confluence.

The model with the check results has been written to "controllercheck/non_blocking_under_control/buc_not_chosen_path.BCFN.out.cif.real".
