Checking for bounded response...
    Computing reachable states:
        Reachable states: Supervisor2b.Start [initial states predicate]

        Forward reachability iteration 1:
            Reachable states: Supervisor2b.Start -> Supervisor2b.Start or Supervisor2b.Done1 [forward reach with edge: (event: Supervisor2b.c_act1) (guard: Supervisor2b.Start) (assignments: Supervisor2b := Supervisor2b.Done1)]
            Reachable states: Supervisor2b.Start or Supervisor2b.Done1 -> not Supervisor2b.Halt [forward reach with edge: (event: Supervisor2b.c_act2) (guard: Supervisor2b.Done1) (assignments: Supervisor2b := Supervisor2b.BothDone)]
            Reachable states: not Supervisor2b.Halt -> true [forward reach with edge: (event: Supervisor2b.u_button_pushed) (guard: true) (assignments: Supervisor2b := Supervisor2b.Halt / Supervisor2b := Supervisor2b.Start / none)]

        Forward reachability iteration 2:
            No change this iteration.

        Reachable states: true [fixed point].

    Computing bound for uncontrollable events...
        Bounded response check round 1 (states before round: true).
        Bounded response check round 2 (states before round: Supervisor2b.Start or Supervisor2b.Halt).

        Bound: n/a (cycle).

    Computing bound for controllable events...
        Bounded response check round 1 (states before round: true).
        Bounded response check round 2 (states before round: Supervisor2b.BothDone or Supervisor2b.Done1).
        Bounded response check round 3 (states before round: Supervisor2b.BothDone).

        Bound: 2.

    Bounded response check completed.

Checking for non-blocking under control...
    Computing the condition for no controllable event to be enabled...
    Condition under which no controllable event is enabled: Supervisor2b.BothDone or Supervisor2b.Halt

    Computing the controllable-complete path states...
    Controllable-complete path states: Supervisor2b.Halt [controllable-complete path end states predicate]

    Backward reachability iteration 1:
        No change this iteration.
    Controllable-complete path states: Supervisor2b.Halt

    Computing the bad states...
    Bad states: not Supervisor2b.Halt [not controllable-complete path states predicate]

    Backward reachability iteration 1:
        No change this iteration.
    Bad states: not Supervisor2b.Halt

    Computing the result of the non-blocking under control check...
    Initial states: Supervisor2b.Start
    Bad initial states: Supervisor2b.Start

Checking for finite response...
    Iteration 1.

Checking for confluence...
    Mutual exclusive event pairs:
        (Supervisor2b.c_act1, Supervisor2b.c_act2)

CONCLUSION:
    [ERROR] The specification does NOT have bounded response:

        - An infinite sequence of transitions is possible for uncontrollable events.
        - A sequence of at most 2 transitions is possible for controllable events.

    [ERROR] The specification is NOT non-blocking under control.
    [OK] The specification has finite response.
    [OK] The specification has confluence.

The model with the check results has been written to "controllercheck/non_blocking_under_control/docs_example_2b.BCFN.out.cif.real".
