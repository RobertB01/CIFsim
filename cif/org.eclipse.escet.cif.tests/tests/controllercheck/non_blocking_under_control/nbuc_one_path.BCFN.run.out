Checking for bounded response...
    Computing reachable states...
    Reachable states: Supervisor.Start [initial states predicate]

    Forward reachability iteration 1:
        Reachable states: Supervisor.Start -> not Supervisor.BothDone [forward reach with edge: (event: Supervisor.c_act1) (guard: Supervisor.Start) (assignments: Supervisor := Supervisor.Done1)]
        Reachable states: not Supervisor.BothDone -> true [forward reach with edge: (event: Supervisor.c_act2) (guard: Supervisor.Done1) (assignments: Supervisor := Supervisor.BothDone)]

    Forward reachability iteration 2:
        No change this iteration.

    Reachable states: true [fixed point].

    Computing bound for uncontrollable events...
    Bounded response check round 1 (states before round: true).
    Bounded response check round 2 (states before round: Supervisor.Start).

    Computing bound for controllable events...
    Bounded response check round 1 (states before round: true).
    Bounded response check round 2 (states before round: not Supervisor.Start).
    Bounded response check round 3 (states before round: Supervisor.BothDone).

    Bounded response check completed.

Checking for non-blocking under control...
    Computing the condition for no controllable event to be enabled...
    Condition under which no controllable event is enabled: Supervisor.BothDone

    Computing the controllable-complete path states...
    Controllable-complete path states: Supervisor.BothDone [controllable-complete path end states predicate]

    Backward reachability iteration 1:
        Controllable-complete path states: Supervisor.BothDone -> not Supervisor.Start [backward reach with edge: (event: Supervisor.c_act2) (guard: Supervisor.Done1) (assignments: Supervisor := Supervisor.BothDone)]

    Backward reachability iteration 2:
        Controllable-complete path states: not Supervisor.Start -> true [backward reach with edge: (event: Supervisor.c_act1) (guard: Supervisor.Start) (assignments: Supervisor := Supervisor.Done1)]

    Backward reachability iteration 3:
        No change this iteration.

    Controllable-complete path states: true [fixed point].
    Controllable-complete path states: true

    Computing the bad states...
    Bad states: false [not controllable-complete path states predicate]

    Backward reachability iteration 1:
        No change this iteration.
    Bad states: false

    Computing the result of the non-blocking under control check...
    Initial states: Supervisor.Start
    Bad initial states: false

Checking for finite response...
    Iteration 1.

Checking for confluence...
    Mutual exclusive event pairs:
        (Supervisor.c_act1, Supervisor.c_act2)

CONCLUSION:
    [OK] The specification has bounded response:

        - A sequence of at most 1 transition is possible for uncontrollable events.
        - A sequence of at most 2 transitions is possible for controllable events.

    [OK] The specification is non-blocking under control.
    [OK] The specification has finite response.
    [OK] The specification has confluence.

The model with the check results has been written to "controllercheck/non_blocking_under_control/nbuc_one_path.BCFN.out.cif.real".
