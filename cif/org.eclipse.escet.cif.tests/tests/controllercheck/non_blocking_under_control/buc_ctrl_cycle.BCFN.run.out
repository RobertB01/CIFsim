Checking for bounded response...
Computing reachable states...
Reachable states: Supervisor.Start [initial states predicate]
Forward reachability: iteration 1.
Reachable states: Supervisor.Start -> not Supervisor.BothDone [forward reach with edge: (event: Supervisor.c_act1) (guard: Supervisor.Start) (assignments: Supervisor := Supervisor.Done1)]
Reachable states: not Supervisor.BothDone -> true [forward reach with edge: (event: Supervisor.c_act2) (guard: Supervisor.Done1) (assignments: Supervisor := Supervisor.BothDone)]
Forward reachability: iteration 2.
Reachable states: true [fixed point].

Computing bound for uncontrollable events...
Bounded response check round 1 (states before round: true).

Computing bound for controllable events...
Bounded response check round 1 (states before round: true).

Bounded response check completed.

Checking for non-blocking under control...
Computing the condition for no controllable event to be enabled...
Condition under which no controllable event is enabled: false

Computing the controllable-complete path states...
Controllable-complete path states: false [controllable-complete path end states predicate]
Backward reachability: iteration 1.
Controllable-complete path states: false

Computing the bad states...
Bad states: true [not controllable-complete path states predicate]
Backward reachability: iteration 1.
Bad states: true

Computing the result of the non-blocking under control check...
Initial states: Supervisor.Start
Bad initial states: Supervisor.Start

Checking for finite response...

Iteration 1.
    The following events have been encountered in a controllable-event loop of automaton Supervisor:
        (Supervisor.c_act1 Supervisor.c_act2 Supervisor.c_act3), which is not controllable unconnectable.

Checking for confluence...

Mutual exclusive event pairs:
    (Supervisor.c_act1, Supervisor.c_act2), (Supervisor.c_act1, Supervisor.c_act3), (Supervisor.c_act2, Supervisor.c_act3)

CONCLUSION:
    [ERROR] The specification does NOT have bounded response:

        - No transitions are possible for uncontrollable events.
        - An infinite sequence of transitions is possible for controllable events.

    [ERROR] The specification is NOT non-blocking under control.

    [ERROR] The specification may NOT have finite response:

        At least one controllable-event loop was found.
        The following events might still occur in a controllable-event loop:
            - Supervisor.c_act1
            - Supervisor.c_act2
            - Supervisor.c_act3

    [OK] The specification has confluence.

The model with the check results has been written to "controllercheck/non_blocking_under_control/buc_ctrl_cycle.BCFN.out.cif.real".
