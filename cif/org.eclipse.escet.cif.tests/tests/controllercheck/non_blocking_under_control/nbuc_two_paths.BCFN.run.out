Controllable-complete path states: true

Computing the bad states...
Bad states: false [not controllable-complete path states predicate]
Backward reachability: iteration 1.
Bad states: false

Checking for finite response...

Iteration 1.

Checking for confluence...

Independent event pairs:
    (Supervisor1.c_act1, Supervisor1.c_act2)

CONCLUSION:
    [OK] The specification has bounded response:
    
        - A sequence of at most 1 transition is possible for uncontrollable events.
        - A sequence of at most 2 transitions is possible for controllable events.

    [OK] The specification is non-blocking under control.
    [OK] The specification has finite response.
    [OK] The specification has confluence.

The model with the check results has been written to "controllercheck/non_blocking_under_control/nbuc_two_paths.BCFN.out.cif.real".
