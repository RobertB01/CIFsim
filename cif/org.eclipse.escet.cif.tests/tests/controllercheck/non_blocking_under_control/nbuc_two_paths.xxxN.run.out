Checking for non-blocking under control...
    Computing the condition for no controllable event to be enabled:
        Condition under which no controllable event is enabled: Supervisor1.BothDone

    Computing the controllable-complete path states...
        Controllable-complete path states: Supervisor1.BothDone [controllable-complete path end states predicate]

        Backward reachability iteration 1:
            Controllable-complete path states: Supervisor1.BothDone -> Supervisor1.Done2 or Supervisor1.BothDone [backward reach with edge: (event: Supervisor1.c_act1) (guard: Supervisor1.Start or Supervisor1.Done2) (assignments: Supervisor1 := Supervisor1.Done1 / Supervisor1 := Supervisor1.BothDone)]
            Controllable-complete path states: Supervisor1.Done2 or Supervisor1.BothDone -> true [backward reach with edge: (event: Supervisor1.c_act2) (guard: Supervisor1.Start or Supervisor1.Done1) (assignments: Supervisor1 := Supervisor1.Done2 / Supervisor1 := Supervisor1.BothDone)]

        Backward reachability iteration 2:
            No change this iteration.

        Controllable-complete path states: true [fixed point].

        Controllable-complete path states: true

    Computing the bad states...
        Bad states: false [not controllable-complete path states predicate]

        Backward reachability iteration 1:
            No change this iteration.

        Bad states: false

    Computing the result of the non-blocking under control check...
        Initial states: Supervisor1.Start
        Bad initial states: false

    Non-blocking under control: yes

CONCLUSION:
    [UNKNOWN] Bounded response checking was disabled, bounded response property is unknown.
    [OK] The specification is non-blocking under control.
    [UNKNOWN] Finite response checking was disabled, finite response property is unknown.
    [UNKNOWN] Confluence checking was disabled, confluence property is unknown.

The model with the check results has been written to "controllercheck/non_blocking_under_control/nbuc_two_paths.xxxN.out.cif.real".
