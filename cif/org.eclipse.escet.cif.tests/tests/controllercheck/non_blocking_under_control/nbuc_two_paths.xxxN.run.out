Checking for non-blocking under control...
    Computing the condition for no controllable event to be enabled...
    Condition under which no controllable event is enabled: Supervisor1.BothDone

    Computing the controllable-complete path states...
    Controllable-complete path states: Supervisor1.BothDone [controllable-complete path end states predicate]
    Controllable-complete path states: true [fixed point].
    Controllable-complete path states: true

    Computing the bad states...
    Bad states: false [not controllable-complete path states predicate]
    Bad states: false

    Computing the result of the non-blocking under control check...
    Initial states: Supervisor1.Start
    Bad initial states: false

CONCLUSION:
    [UNKNOWN] Bounded response checking was disabled, bounded response property is unknown.
    [OK] The specification is non-blocking under control.
    [UNKNOWN] Finite response checking was disabled, finite response property is unknown.
    [UNKNOWN] Confluence checking was disabled, confluence property is unknown.

The model with the check results has been written to "controllercheck/non_blocking_under_control/nbuc_two_paths.xxxN.out.cif.real".
