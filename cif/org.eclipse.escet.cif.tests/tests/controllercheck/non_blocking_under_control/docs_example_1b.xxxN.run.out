CONCLUSION:
    [UNKNOWN] Bounded response checking was disabled, bounded response property is unknown.
    [ERROR] The specification is NOT non-blocking under control.
    [UNKNOWN] Finite response checking was disabled, finite response property is unknown.
    [UNKNOWN] Confluence checking was disabled, confluence property is unknown.

The model with the check results has been written to "controllercheck/non_blocking_under_control/docs_example_1b.xxxN.out.cif.real".
