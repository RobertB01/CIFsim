    Condition under which no controllable event is enabled: Supervisor1a.BothDone

    Computing the controllable-complete path states...
    Controllable-complete path states: Supervisor1a.BothDone [controllable-complete path end states predicate]
    Backward reachability: iteration 1.

Checking for finite response...

    Iteration 1.

Checking for confluence...

    Independent event pairs:
        (Supervisor1a.c_act1, Supervisor1a.c_act2)

CONCLUSION:
    [ERROR] The specification does NOT have bounded response:

        - An infinite sequence of transitions is possible for uncontrollable events.
        - A sequence of at most 2 transitions is possible for controllable events.

    [OK] The specification is non-blocking under control.
    [OK] The specification has finite response.
    [OK] The specification has confluence.

The model with the check results has been written to "controllercheck/non_blocking_under_control/docs_example_1a.BCFN.out.cif.real".
