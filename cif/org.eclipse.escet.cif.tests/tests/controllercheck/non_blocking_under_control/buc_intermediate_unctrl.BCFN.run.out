        Forward reachability iteration 2:
            No change this iteration.

        Reachable states: true [fixed point].

    Computing bound for uncontrollable events:
        Bounded response check round 1 (states before round: true).
        Bounded response check round 2 (states before round: Supervisor.Start or Supervisor.Halt).

        Bound: 1.

    Computing bound for controllable events:
        Bounded response check round 1 (states before round: true).
        Bounded response check round 2 (states before round: Supervisor.BothDone or Supervisor.Done1).
        Bounded response check round 3 (states before round: Supervisor.BothDone).

        Bound: 2.

    Bounded response check completed.

Checking for non-blocking under control:
    Computing the condition for no controllable event to be enabled:
        Condition under which no controllable event is enabled: Supervisor.BothDone or Supervisor.Halt

    Computing the bad states:
        Bad states: not Supervisor.Halt [not controllable-complete path states predicate]

        Backward reachability iteration 1:
            No change this iteration.

        Bad states: not Supervisor.Halt

    Computing the result of the non-blocking under control check:
        Initial states: Supervisor.Start
        Bad initial states: Supervisor.Start

    Non-blocking under control: no

Checking for finite response:
    Iteration 1.

Checking for confluence:
    Mutual exclusive event pairs:
        (Supervisor.c_act1, Supervisor.c_act2)

    All pairs proven. Confluence holds.

CONCLUSION:
    [OK] The specification has bounded response:

        - A sequence of at most 1 transition is possible for uncontrollable events.
        - A sequence of at most 2 transitions is possible for controllable events.

    [ERROR] The specification is NOT non-blocking under control.
    [OK] The specification has finite response.
    [OK] The specification has confluence.

The model with the check results has been written to "controllercheck/non_blocking_under_control/buc_intermediate_unctrl.BCFN.out.cif.real".
