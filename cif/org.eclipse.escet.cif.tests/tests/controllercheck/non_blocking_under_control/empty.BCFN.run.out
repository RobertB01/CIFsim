Loading CIF specification "controllercheck/non_blocking_under_control/empty.cif".
Preparing for BDD-based checks:
    The specification has no BDD variables.

    Restricting system behavior using state/event exclusion plant invariants:
        No guards changed.

Preparing for MDD-based checks:

Checking for bounded response:
    Computing reachable states:
        Reachable states: true [initial states predicate]

    Computing bound for uncontrollable events:
        Bounded response check round 1 (states before round: true).

        Bound: 0.

    Computing bound for controllable events:
        Bounded response check round 1 (states before round: true).

        Bound: 0.

    Bounded response check completed.

Checking for non-blocking under control:
    Computing the condition for no controllable event to be enabled:
        Condition under which no controllable event is enabled: true

    Computing the controllable-complete path states:
        Controllable-complete path states: true [controllable-complete path end states predicate]

        Controllable-complete path states: true

    Computing the bad states:
        Bad states: false [not controllable-complete path states predicate]

        Bad states: false

    Computing the result of the non-blocking under control check:
        Initial states: true
        Bad initial states: false

    Non-blocking under control: yes

Checking for finite response:

Checking for confluence:

CONCLUSION:
    [OK] The specification has bounded response:

        - No transitions are possible for uncontrollable events.
        - No transitions are possible for controllable events.

    [OK] The specification is non-blocking under control.
    [OK] The specification has finite response.
    [OK] The specification has confluence.

The model with the check results has been written to "controllercheck/non_blocking_under_control/empty.BCFN.out.cif.real".
