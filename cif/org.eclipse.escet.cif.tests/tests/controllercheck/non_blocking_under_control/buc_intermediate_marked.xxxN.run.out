Checking for non-blocking under control...
    Computing the condition for no controllable event to be enabled...
    Condition under which no controllable event is enabled: Supervisor.BothDone

    Computing the controllable-complete path states...
    Controllable-complete path states: false [controllable-complete path end states predicate]
    Backward reachability: iteration 1.
    Controllable-complete path states: false

    Computing the bad states...
    Bad states: true [not controllable-complete path states predicate]
    Backward reachability: iteration 1.
    Bad states: true

    Computing the result of the non-blocking under control check...
    Initial states: Supervisor.Start
    Bad initial states: Supervisor.Start

CONCLUSION:
    [UNKNOWN] Bounded response checking was disabled, bounded response property is unknown.
    [ERROR] The specification is NOT non-blocking under control.
    [UNKNOWN] Finite response checking was disabled, finite response property is unknown.
    [UNKNOWN] Confluence checking was disabled, confluence property is unknown.

The model with the check results has been written to "controllercheck/non_blocking_under_control/buc_intermediate_marked.xxxN.out.cif.real".
