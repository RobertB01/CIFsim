Loading CIF specification "controllercheck/disabled_evts.cif"...
Prepare for the checks...
Analyzing automaton "A"...
    Initialize the automaton data for event "c_a"...
    Process edges from location "location "l1" of automaton "A""...
    Update global guards and updates for event "c_a"...
Analyzing automaton "B"...
    Initialize the automaton data for event "c_a"...
    Process edges from location "location "l2" of automaton "B""...
    Update global guards and updates for event "c_a"...

Checking for confluence...

CONCLUSION:
    Finite response checking was disabled, finite response property is unknown.
    [OK] The specification has confluence.
