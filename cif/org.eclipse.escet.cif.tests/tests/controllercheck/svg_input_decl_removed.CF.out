Loading CIF specification "controllercheck/svg_input_decl_removed.cif"...
Prepare for the checks...
Analyzing automaton "p"...
    Initialize the automaton data for event "p.c"...
    Process edges from location "the location of automaton "p""...
    Update global guards and updates for event "p.c"...
Checking for finite response...

Iteration 1.
    The following events have been encountered in a controllable-event loop of automaton p:
        (p.c), which is not controllable unconnectable.

Checking for confluence...

CONCLUSION:
    [ERROR] The specification may NOT have finite response.
    
        At least one controllable-event loop was found.
        The following events might still occur in a controllable-event loop:
            - p.c

    [OK] The specification has confluence.
