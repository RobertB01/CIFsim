Iteration 1.
    The following events have been encountered in a controllable-event loop of automaton p:
        (p.c), which is not controllable unconnectable.

Checking for confluence...

CONCLUSION:
    [ERROR] The specification may NOT have finite response.
    
        At least one controllable-event loop was found.
        The following events might still occur in a controllable-event loop:
            - p.c

    [OK] The specification has confluence.
