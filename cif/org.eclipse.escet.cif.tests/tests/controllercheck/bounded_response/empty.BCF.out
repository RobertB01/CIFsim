CONCLUSION:
    [OK] The specification has bounded response:
    
        - No transitions are possible for uncontrollable events.
        - No transitions are possible for controllable events.

    [OK] The specification has finite response.
    [OK] The specification has confluence.

The model with the check results has been written to "controllercheck/bounded_response/empty.checked.cif".
