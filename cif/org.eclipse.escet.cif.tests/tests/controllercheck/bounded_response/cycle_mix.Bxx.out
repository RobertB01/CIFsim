Checking for bounded response...
Computing reachable states...
Reachable states: p.loc1 [initial states predicate]
Forward reachability: iteration 1.
Reachable states: p.loc1 -> p.loc1 or p.loc3 [forward reach with edge: (event: u_e1) (guard: p.loc1) (assignments: p := p.loc3)]
Reachable states: p.loc1 or p.loc3 -> p.loc1 or (p.loc3 or p.loc2) [forward reach with edge: (event: c_c1) (guard: p.loc1) (assignments: p := p.loc2)]
Reachable states: p.loc1 or (p.loc3 or p.loc2) -> p.loc1 or p.loc2 or (p.loc3 or p.loc4) [forward reach with edge: (event: u_c1) (guard: p.loc3) (assignments: p := p.loc4)]
Reachable states: p.loc1 or p.loc2 or (p.loc3 or p.loc4) -> not p.loc7 and (not p.loc6 and not p.loc8) [forward reach with edge: (event: u_e2) (guard: p.loc3) (assignments: p := p.loc5)]
Reachable states: not p.loc7 and (not p.loc6 and not p.loc8) -> not p.loc7 and not p.loc8 [forward reach with edge: (event: u_e3) (guard: p.loc5) (assignments: p := p.loc6)]
Reachable states: not p.loc7 and not p.loc8 -> not p.loc8 [forward reach with edge: (event: c_e2) (guard: p.loc6) (assignments: p := p.loc7)]
Reachable states: not p.loc8 -> true [forward reach with edge: (event: c_e3) (guard: p.loc7) (assignments: p := p.loc8)]
Forward reachability: iteration 2.
Reachable states: true [fixed point].

Computing bound for uncontrollable events...
Bounded response check round 1 (states before round: true).
Bounded response check round 2 (states before round: p.loc5 or p.loc6 or (p.loc3 or p.loc4)).

Computing bound for controllable events...
Bounded response check round 1 (states before round: true).
Bounded response check round 2 (states before round: p.loc1 or p.loc2 or (p.loc7 or p.loc8)).
Bounded response check round 3 (states before round: p.loc1 or (p.loc2 or p.loc8)).
Bounded response check round 4 (states before round: p.loc1 or p.loc2).

Bounded response check completed.

CONCLUSION:
    [ERROR] The specification does NOT have bounded response:
    
        - An infinite sequence of transitions is possible for uncontrollable events.
        - An infinite sequence of transitions is possible for controllable events.

    [UNKNOWN] Finite response checking was disabled, finite response property is unknown.
    [UNKNOWN] Confluence checking was disabled, confluence property is unknown.

The model with the check results has been written to "controllercheck/bounded_response/cycle_mix.checked.cif".
