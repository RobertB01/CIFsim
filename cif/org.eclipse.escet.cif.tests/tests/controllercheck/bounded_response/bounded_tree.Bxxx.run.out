Checking for bounded response...
    Computing reachable states...
    Reachable states: p2.loc1 and p1.loc1 [initial states predicate]

    Forward reachability iteration 1:
        Reachable states: p2.loc1 and p1.loc1 -> p2.loc1 and (p1.loc1 or p1.loc2) [forward reach with edge: (event: u_a) (guard: p1.loc1) (assignments: p1 := p1.loc2)]

        Reachable states: p2.loc1 and (p1.loc1 or p1.loc5) or p2.loc1 and p1.loc2 -> p2.loc1 and (p1.loc1 or p1.loc5) or (p2.loc1 and p1.loc3 or p2.loc1 and p1.loc2) [forward reach with edge: (event: u_b) (guard: p1.loc2) (assignments: p1 := p1.loc3)]
        Reachable states: p2.loc1 and (p1.loc1 or p1.loc5) or (p2.loc1 and p1.loc3 or p2.loc1 and p1.loc2) -> not p2.loc5 and (not p2.loc3 and (p2.loc1 or (p2.loc3 or p2.loc5))) [forward reach with edge: (event: u_c) (guard: p1.loc2) (assignments: p1 := p1.loc4)]
        Reachable states: not p2.loc5 and (not p2.loc3 and (p2.loc1 or (p2.loc3 or p2.loc5))) -> not p2.loc5 and not p2.loc6 and (not p2.loc3 and not p2.loc4) [forward reach with edge: (event: c_a) (guard: p2.loc1) (assignments: p2 := p2.loc2)]
        Reachable states: not p2.loc5 and not p2.loc6 and (not p2.loc3 and not p2.loc4) -> not p2.loc5 and (not p2.loc6 and not p2.loc4) [forward reach with edge: (event: c_b) (guard: p2.loc2) (assignments: p2 := p2.loc3)]
        Reachable states: not p2.loc5 and (not p2.loc6 and not p2.loc4) -> not p2.loc6 and not p2.loc4 [forward reach with edge: (event: c_d) (guard: p2.loc2) (assignments: p2 := p2.loc5)]
        Reachable states: not p2.loc6 and not p2.loc4 -> not p2.loc6 [forward reach with edge: (event: c_c) (guard: p2.loc3) (assignments: p2 := p2.loc4)]
        Reachable states: not p2.loc6 -> true [forward reach with edge: (event: c_e) (guard: p2.loc3) (assignments: p2 := p2.loc6)]

    Forward reachability iteration 2:
        No change this iteration.

    Reachable states: true [fixed point].

    Computing bound for uncontrollable events...
    Bounded response check round 1 (states before round: true).
    Bounded response check round 2 (states before round: (p2.loc3 or (p2.loc4 or not p1.loc1)) and (not p2.loc3 and not p2.loc4 or not p1.loc1)).
    Bounded response check round 3 (states before round: (p2.loc3 or p2.loc4 or (p1.loc3 or p1.loc4)) and (not p2.loc3 and not p2.loc4 or (p1.loc3 or p1.loc4))).

    Computing bound for controllable events...
    Bounded response check round 1 (states before round: true).
    Bounded response check round 2 (states before round: <bdd 8n 12p>).
    Bounded response check round 3 (states before round: not p2.loc1 and not p2.loc2).
    Bounded response check round 4 (states before round: (p2.loc2 or (p2.loc4 or p2.loc6)) and not p2.loc2).

    Bounded response check completed.

CONCLUSION:
    [OK] The specification has bounded response:

        - A sequence of at most 2 transitions is possible for uncontrollable events.
        - A sequence of at most 3 transitions is possible for controllable events.

    [UNKNOWN] Non-blocking under control checking was disabled, non-blocking under control property is unknown.
    [UNKNOWN] Finite response checking was disabled, finite response property is unknown.
    [UNKNOWN] Confluence checking was disabled, confluence property is unknown.

The model with the check results has been written to "controllercheck/bounded_response/bounded_tree.Bxxx.out.cif.real".
