Checking for bounded response:
    Computing reachable states:
        Reachable states: p2.loc1 and p1.loc1 [initial states predicate]

        Reachable states: true [fixed point].

    Computing bound for uncontrollable events:
        Bounded response check round 1 (states before round: true).
        Bounded response check round 2 (states before round: (p2.loc3 or (p2.loc4 or not p1.loc1)) and (not p2.loc3 and not p2.loc4 or not p1.loc1)).
        Bounded response check round 3 (states before round: (p2.loc3 or p2.loc4 or (p1.loc3 or p1.loc4)) and (not p2.loc3 and not p2.loc4 or (p1.loc3 or p1.loc4))).

        Bound: 2.

    Computing bound for controllable events:
        Bounded response check round 1 (states before round: true).
        Bounded response check round 2 (states before round: <bdd 8n 12p>).
        Bounded response check round 3 (states before round: not p2.loc1 and not p2.loc2).
        Bounded response check round 4 (states before round: (p2.loc2 or (p2.loc4 or p2.loc6)) and not p2.loc2).

        Bound: 3.

    Bounded response check completed.

CONCLUSION:
    [OK] The specification has bounded response:

        - A sequence of at most 2 transitions is possible for uncontrollable events.
        - A sequence of at most 3 transitions is possible for controllable events.

    [UNKNOWN] Non-blocking under control checking was disabled, non-blocking under control property is unknown.
    [UNKNOWN] Finite response checking was disabled, finite response property is unknown.
    [UNKNOWN] Confluence checking was disabled, confluence property is unknown.

The model with the check results has been written to "controllercheck/bounded_response/bounded_tree.Bxxx.out.cif.real".
