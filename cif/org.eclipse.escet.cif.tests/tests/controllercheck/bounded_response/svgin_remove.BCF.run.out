Bounded response check completed.

Checking for finite response...

Iteration 1.
    The following events have been encountered in a controllable-event loop of automaton p:
        (c_e), which is not controllable unconnectable.

Checking for confluence...

CONCLUSION:
    [ERROR] The specification does NOT have bounded response:
    
        - No transitions are possible for uncontrollable events.
        - An infinite sequence of transitions is possible for controllable events.

    [ERROR] The specification may NOT have finite response:
    
        At least one controllable-event loop was found.
        The following events might still occur in a controllable-event loop:
            - c_e

    [OK] The specification has confluence.

The model with the check results has been written to "controllercheck/bounded_response/svgin_remove.BCF.out.cif.real".
