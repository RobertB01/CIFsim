    Computing the result of the non-blocking under control check...
    Initial states: p.xc = 0 and p.xu = 0
    Bad initial states: false

Checking for finite response...
    Iteration 1.
        The following events have been encountered in a controllable-event loop of automaton p:
            (c), which is not controllable unconnectable.
        The following events have been encountered in a controllable-event loop of automaton SupervisorStateEvtExcls:
            (c), which is not controllable unconnectable.

Checking for confluence...

CONCLUSION:
    [OK] The specification has bounded response:

        - A sequence of at most 4 transitions is possible for uncontrollable events.
        - A sequence of at most 5 transitions is possible for controllable events.

    [OK] The specification is non-blocking under control.

    [ERROR] The specification may NOT have finite response:

        At least one controllable-event loop was found.
        The following events might still occur in a controllable-event loop:
            - c

    [OK] The specification has confluence.

The model with the check results has been written to "controllercheck/bounded_response/bounded_state_evt_excl_inv.BCFN.out.cif.real".
