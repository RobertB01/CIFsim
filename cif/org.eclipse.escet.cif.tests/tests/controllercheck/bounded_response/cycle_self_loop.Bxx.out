Loading CIF specification "controllercheck/bounded_response/cycle_self_loop.cif"...
Preparing for BDD-based checks...

Restricting system behavior using state/event exclusion plant invariants.

Checking for bounded response...
Computing reachable states...
Reachable states: true [initial states predicate]
Forward reachability: iteration 1.

Computing bound for uncontrollable events...
Bounded response check round 1 (states before round: true).

Computing bound for controllable events...
Bounded response check round 1 (states before round: true).

Bounded response check completed.

CONCLUSION:
    [ERROR] The specification does NOT have bounded response for uncontrollable events.
    [OK] The specification has bounded response for controllable events (bound: 0).

    [UNKNOWN] Finite response checking was disabled, finite response property is unknown.
    [UNKNOWN] Confluence checking was disabled, confluence property is unknown.
