Checking for bounded response...
Computing reachable states...
Reachable states: true [initial states predicate]
Forward reachability: iteration 1.

Computing bound for uncontrollable events...
Bounded response check round 1 (states before round: true).
Bounded response check round 2 (states before round: p.counter = 0 or (p.counter = 2 or p.counter = 4) or (p.counter = 6 or (p.counter = 8 or p.counter = 10)) or (p.counter = 12 or (p.counter = 14 or p.counter = 16) or (p.counter = 18 or p.counter = 20 or (p.counter = 22 or p.counter = 24)))).

Computing bound for controllable events...
Bounded response check round 1 (states before round: true).
Bounded response check round 2 (states before round: p.counter = 1 or (p.counter = 3 or p.counter = 5) or (p.counter = 7 or (p.counter = 9 or p.counter = 11)) or (p.counter = 13 or (p.counter = 15 or p.counter = 17) or (p.counter = 19 or p.counter = 21 or (p.counter = 23 or p.counter = 25)))).

Bounded response check completed.

CONCLUSION:
    [OK] The specification has bounded response:
    
        - A sequence of at most 1 transition is possible for uncontrollable events.
        - A sequence of at most 1 transition is possible for controllable events.

    [UNKNOWN] Finite response checking was disabled, finite response property is unknown.
    [UNKNOWN] Confluence checking was disabled, confluence property is unknown.
