Loading CIF specification "controllercheck/bounded_response/svgin_remove.cif".
Preparing for BDD-based checks:
    The specification has no BDD variables.

    Restricting system behavior using state/event exclusion plant invariants:
        No guards changed.

Preparing for MDD-based checks:
    Analyzing automaton "p":
        Initializing the automaton data for event "c_e".
        Processing edges from the location of automaton "p".
        Updating global guards and updates for event "c_e".

    Computing the result of the non-blocking under control check:
        Initial states: true
        Bad initial states: true

    Non-blocking under control: no

Checking for finite response:
    Iteration 1.
        The following events have been encountered in a controllable-event loop of automaton p:
            (c_e), which is not controllable unconnectable.

Checking for confluence:
    No proven pairs.

    All pairs proven. Confluence holds.

CONCLUSION:
    [ERROR] The specification does NOT have bounded response:

        - No transitions are possible for uncontrollable events.
        - An infinite sequence of transitions is possible for controllable events.

    [ERROR] The specification is NOT non-blocking under control.

    [ERROR] The specification may NOT have finite response:

        At least one controllable-event loop was found.
        The following events might still occur in a controllable-event loop:
            - c_e

    [OK] The specification has confluence.

The model with the check results has been written to "controllercheck/bounded_response/svgin_remove.BCFN.out.cif.real".
