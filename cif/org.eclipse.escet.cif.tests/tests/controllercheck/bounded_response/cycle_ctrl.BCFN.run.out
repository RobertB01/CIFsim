Checking for bounded response...
    Computing reachable states:
        Reachable states: p.Off [initial states predicate]

        Forward reachability iteration 1:
            Reachable states: p.Off -> true [forward reach with edge: (event: c_on) (guard: p.Off) (assignments: p := p.On)]

        Forward reachability iteration 2:
            No change this iteration.

        Reachable states: true [fixed point].

    Computing bound for uncontrollable events...
        Bounded response check round 1 (states before round: true).

        Bound: 0.

    Computing bound for controllable events...
        Bounded response check round 1 (states before round: true).

        Bound: n/a (cycle).

    Bounded response check completed.

Checking for non-blocking under control...
    Computing the condition for no controllable event to be enabled...
    Condition under which no controllable event is enabled: false

    Computing the controllable-complete path states...
    Controllable-complete path states: false [controllable-complete path end states predicate]

    Backward reachability iteration 1:
        No change this iteration.
    Controllable-complete path states: false

    Computing the bad states...
    Bad states: true [not controllable-complete path states predicate]

    Backward reachability iteration 1:
        No change this iteration.
    Bad states: true

    Computing the result of the non-blocking under control check...
    Initial states: p.Off
    Bad initial states: p.Off

Checking for finite response...
    Iteration 1.
        The following events have been encountered in a controllable-event loop of automaton p:
            (c_on c_off), which is not controllable unconnectable.

Checking for confluence...
    Mutual exclusive event pairs:
        (c_off, c_on)

CONCLUSION:
    [ERROR] The specification does NOT have bounded response:

        - No transitions are possible for uncontrollable events.
        - An infinite sequence of transitions is possible for controllable events.

    [ERROR] The specification is NOT non-blocking under control.

    [ERROR] The specification may NOT have finite response:

        At least one controllable-event loop was found.
        The following events might still occur in a controllable-event loop:
            - c_off
            - c_on

    [OK] The specification has confluence.

The model with the check results has been written to "controllercheck/bounded_response/cycle_ctrl.BCFN.out.cif.real".
