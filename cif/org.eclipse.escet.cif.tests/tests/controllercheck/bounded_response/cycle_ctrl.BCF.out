Checking for bounded response...
Computing reachable states...
Reachable states: p.Off [initial states predicate]
Forward reachability: iteration 1.
Reachable states: p.Off -> true [forward reach with edge: (event: c_on) (guard: p.Off) (assignments: p := p.On)]
Forward reachability: iteration 2.
Reachable states: true [fixed point].

Computing bound for uncontrollable events...
Bounded response check round 1 (states before round: true).

Computing bound for controllable events...
Bounded response check round 1 (states before round: true).

Bounded response check completed.

Checking for finite response...

Iteration 1.
    The following events have been encountered in a controllable-event loop of automaton p:
        (c_on c_off), which is not controllable unconnectable.

Checking for confluence...

Mutual exclusive event pairs:
    (c_off, c_on)

CONCLUSION:
    [ERROR] The specification does NOT have bounded response:
    
        - No transitions are possible for uncontrollable events.
        - An infinite sequence of transitions is possible for controllable events.

    [ERROR] The specification may NOT have finite response:
    
        At least one controllable-event loop was found.
        The following events might still occur in a controllable-event loop:
            - c_off
            - c_on

    [OK] The specification has confluence.
