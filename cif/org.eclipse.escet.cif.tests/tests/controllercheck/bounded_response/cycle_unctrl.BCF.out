Checking for bounded response...
Computing reachable states...
Reachable states: p.Off [initial states predicate]
Forward reachability: iteration 1.
Reachable states: p.Off -> true [forward reach with edge: (event: u_on) (guard: p.Off) (assignments: p := p.On)]
Forward reachability: iteration 2.
Reachable states: true [fixed point].

Computing bound for uncontrollable events...
Bounded response check round 1 (states before round: true).

Computing bound for controllable events...
Bounded response check round 1 (states before round: true).

Bounded response check completed.

Checking for finite response...

Checking for confluence...

CONCLUSION:
    [ERROR] The specification does NOT have bounded response for uncontrollable events.
    [OK] The specification has bounded response for controllable events (bound: 0).

    [OK] The specification has finite response.
    [OK] The specification has confluence.
