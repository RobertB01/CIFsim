Preparing for BDD-based checks:

    Skipping variable ordering: only one variable present.

    Restricting system behavior using state/event exclusion plant invariants:
        No guards changed.

Preparing for MDD-based checks:
    No controllable events.

Checking for bounded response:
    Computing reachable states:
        Reachable states: p.Off [initial states predicate]

        Reachable states: true [fixed point].

    Computing bound for uncontrollable events:
        Bounded response check round 1 (states before round: true).

        Bound: n/a (cycle).

    Computing bound for controllable events:
        Bounded response check round 1 (states before round: true).

        Bound: 0.

    Bounded response check completed.

Checking for non-blocking under control:
    Computing the condition for no controllable event to be enabled:
        Condition under which no controllable event is enabled: true

    Computing the controllable-complete path states:
        Controllable-complete path states: p.Off [controllable-complete path end states predicate]

        Controllable-complete path states: true [fixed point].

        Controllable-complete path states: true

    Computing the bad states:
        Bad states: false [not controllable-complete path states predicate]

        Bad states: false

    Computing the result of the non-blocking under control check:
        Initial states: p.Off
        Bad initial states: false

    Non-blocking under control: yes

Checking for finite response:
    No controllable events. Finite response trivially holds.

Checking for confluence:
    No controllable events. Confluence trivially holds.

CONCLUSION:
    [ERROR] The specification does NOT have bounded response:

        - An infinite sequence of transitions is possible for uncontrollable events.
        - No transitions are possible for controllable events.

    [OK] The specification is non-blocking under control.
    [OK] The specification has finite response.
    [OK] The specification has confluence.

The model with the check results has been written to "controllercheck/bounded_response/cycle_unctrl.BCFN.out.cif.real".
