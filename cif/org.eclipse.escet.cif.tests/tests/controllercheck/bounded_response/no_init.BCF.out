Iteration 1.
    The following events have been encountered in a controllable-event loop of automaton p:
        (p.e), which is not controllable unconnectable.

CONCLUSION:
    [OK] The specification has bounded response:
    
        [OK] No transitions are possible for uncontrollable events.
        [OK] No transitions are possible for controllable events.

    [ERROR] The specification may NOT have finite response:
    
        At least one controllable-event loop was found.
        The following events might still occur in a controllable-event loop:
            - p.e

    [OK] The specification has confluence.
