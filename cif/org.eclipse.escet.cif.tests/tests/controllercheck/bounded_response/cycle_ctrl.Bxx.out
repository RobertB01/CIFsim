Restricting system behavior using state/event exclusion plant invariants.

Checking for bounded response...
Computing reachable states...
Reachable states: p.Off [initial states predicate]
Forward reachability: iteration 1.
Reachable states: p.Off -> true [forward reach with edge: (event: c_on) (guard: p.Off) (assignments: p := p.On)]
Forward reachability: iteration 2.
Reachable states: true [fixed point].

Computing bound for uncontrollable events...
Bounded response check round 1 (states before round: true).

Computing bound for controllable events...
Bounded response check round 1 (states before round: true).

Bounded response check completed.

CONCLUSION:
    [ERROR] The specification does NOT have bounded response:
    
        [OK] No transitions are possible for uncontrollable events.
        [ERROR] An infinite sequence of transitions is possible for controllable events.

    [UNKNOWN] Finite response checking was disabled, finite response property is unknown.
    [UNKNOWN] Confluence checking was disabled, confluence property is unknown.
