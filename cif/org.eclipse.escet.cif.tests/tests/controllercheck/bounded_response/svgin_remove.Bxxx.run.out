Loading CIF specification "controllercheck/bounded_response/svgin_remove.cif".
Preparing for BDD-based checks:
    The specification has no BDD variables.

    Restricting system behavior using state/event exclusion plant invariants:
        No guards changed.

        Forward reachability iteration 1:
            No change this iteration.

    Computing bound for uncontrollable events:
        Bounded response check round 1 (states before round: true).

        Bound: 0.

    Computing bound for controllable events:
        Bounded response check round 1 (states before round: true).

        Bound: n/a (cycle).

    Bounded response check completed.

CONCLUSION:
    [ERROR] The specification does NOT have bounded response:

        - No transitions are possible for uncontrollable events.
        - An infinite sequence of transitions is possible for controllable events.

    [UNKNOWN] Non-blocking under control checking was disabled, non-blocking under control property is unknown.
    [UNKNOWN] Finite response checking was disabled, finite response property is unknown.
    [UNKNOWN] Confluence checking was disabled, confluence property is unknown.

The model with the check results has been written to "controllercheck/bounded_response/svgin_remove.Bxxx.out.cif.real".
