Checking for finite response...
    Iteration 1.
        The following events have been encountered in a controllable-event loop of automaton p:
            (c_c1 c_c2), which is not controllable unconnectable.

    Iteration 2.
        The following events have been encountered in a controllable-event loop of automaton p:
            (c_c1 c_c2), which is not controllable unconnectable.

Checking for confluence...
    Mutual exclusive event pairs:
        (c_c1, c_c2), (c_c1, c_e1), (c_c1, c_e2), (c_c1, c_e3), (c_c2, c_e1), (c_c2, c_e2), (c_c2, c_e3), (c_e1, c_e2), (c_e1, c_e3), (c_e2, c_e3)

CONCLUSION:
    [ERROR] The specification does NOT have bounded response:

        - An infinite sequence of transitions is possible for uncontrollable events.
        - An infinite sequence of transitions is possible for controllable events.

    [ERROR] The specification is NOT non-blocking under control.

    [ERROR] The specification may NOT have finite response:

        At least one controllable-event loop was found.
        The following events might still occur in a controllable-event loop:
            - c_c1
            - c_c2

    [OK] The specification has confluence.

The model with the check results has been written to "controllercheck/bounded_response/cycle_mix.BCFN.out.cif.real".
