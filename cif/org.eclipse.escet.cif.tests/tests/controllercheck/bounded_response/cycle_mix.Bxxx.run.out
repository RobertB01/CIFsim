Checking for bounded response...
    Computing reachable states...
    Reachable states: p.loc1 [initial states predicate]
    Reachable states: true [fixed point].

    Computing bound for uncontrollable events...
    Bounded response check round 1 (states before round: true).
    Bounded response check round 2 (states before round: p.loc5 or p.loc6 or (p.loc3 or p.loc4)).

    Computing bound for controllable events...
    Bounded response check round 1 (states before round: true).
    Bounded response check round 2 (states before round: p.loc1 or p.loc2 or (p.loc7 or p.loc8)).
    Bounded response check round 3 (states before round: p.loc1 or (p.loc2 or p.loc8)).
    Bounded response check round 4 (states before round: p.loc1 or p.loc2).

    Bounded response check completed.

CONCLUSION:
    [ERROR] The specification does NOT have bounded response:

        - An infinite sequence of transitions is possible for uncontrollable events.
        - An infinite sequence of transitions is possible for controllable events.

    [UNKNOWN] Non-blocking under control checking was disabled, non-blocking under control property is unknown.
    [UNKNOWN] Finite response checking was disabled, finite response property is unknown.
    [UNKNOWN] Confluence checking was disabled, confluence property is unknown.

The model with the check results has been written to "controllercheck/bounded_response/cycle_mix.Bxxx.out.cif.real".
