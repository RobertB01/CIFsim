    Computing reachable states...
    Reachable states: true [initial states predicate]

    Computing bound for uncontrollable events...
    Bounded response check round 1 (states before round: true).

    Computing bound for controllable events...
    Bounded response check round 1 (states before round: true).

    Bounded response check completed.

    Condition under which no controllable event is enabled: false

    Computing the controllable-complete path states...
    Controllable-complete path states: false [controllable-complete path end states predicate]
    Backward reachability: iteration 1.
    Controllable-complete path states: false

    Computing the bad states...
    Bad states: true [not controllable-complete path states predicate]
    Backward reachability: iteration 1.
    Bad states: true

    Computing the result of the non-blocking under control check...
    Initial states: true
    Bad initial states: true

Checking for finite response...
    Iteration 1.
        The following events have been encountered in a controllable-event loop of automaton p:
            (c_inc), which is not controllable unconnectable.
            (c_dec), which is not controllable unconnectable.

Checking for confluence...
    Independent event pairs:
        (c_dec, c_inc)

CONCLUSION:
    [ERROR] The specification does NOT have bounded response:

        - No transitions are possible for uncontrollable events.
        - An infinite sequence of transitions is possible for controllable events.

    [ERROR] The specification is NOT non-blocking under control.

    [ERROR] The specification may NOT have finite response:

        At least one controllable-event loop was found.
        The following events might still occur in a controllable-event loop:
            - c_dec
            - c_inc

    [OK] The specification has confluence.

The model with the check results has been written to "controllercheck/bounded_response/cycle_counter_any.BCFN.out.cif.real".
