    Reachable states: pu.loc1 and pc.loc1 [initial states predicate]
    Forward reachability: iteration 1.

    Computing bound for uncontrollable events...
    Bounded response check round 1 (states before round: true).

    Computing bound for controllable events...
    Bounded response check round 1 (states before round: true).

    Bounded response check completed.

CONCLUSION:
    [ERROR] The specification does NOT have bounded response:

        - An infinite sequence of transitions is possible for uncontrollable events.
        - An infinite sequence of transitions is possible for controllable events.

    [UNKNOWN] Non-blocking under control checking was disabled, non-blocking under control property is unknown.
    [UNKNOWN] Finite response checking was disabled, finite response property is unknown.
    [UNKNOWN] Confluence checking was disabled, confluence property is unknown.

The model with the check results has been written to "controllercheck/bounded_response/cycle_in_cycle.Bxxx.out.cif.real".
