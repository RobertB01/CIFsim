Checking for bounded response...
Computing reachable states...
Reachable states: true [initial states predicate]
Forward reachability: iteration 1.

Computing bound for uncontrollable events...
Bounded response check round 1 (states before round: true).

Computing bound for controllable events...
Bounded response check round 1 (states before round: true).

Bounded response check completed.

Checking for finite response...

Checking for confluence...

CONCLUSION:
    [ERROR] The specification does NOT have bounded response:
    
        - An infinite sequence of transitions is possible for uncontrollable events.
        - No transitions are possible for controllable events.

    [OK] The specification has finite response.
    [OK] The specification has confluence.

The model with the check results has been written to "controllercheck/bounded_response/cycle_self_loop.BCF.out.cif.real".
