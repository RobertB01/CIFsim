Loading CIF specification "controllercheck/mdd/disabled_evts.cif"...
Preparing for BDD-based checks...

    Restricting system behavior using state/event exclusion plant invariants.

Checking for non-blocking under control...
Computing the condition for no controllable event to be enabled...
Condition under which no controllable event is enabled: true

Computing the controllable-complete path states...
Controllable-complete path states: false [controllable-complete path end states predicate]
Controllable-complete path states: false

Computing the bad states...
Bad states: true [not controllable-complete path states predicate]
Bad states: true

Computing the result of the non-blocking under control check...
Initial states: true
Bad initial states: true

CONCLUSION:
    [UNKNOWN] Bounded response checking was disabled, bounded response property is unknown.
    [ERROR] The specification is NOT non-blocking under control.
    [UNKNOWN] Finite response checking was disabled, finite response property is unknown.
    [UNKNOWN] Confluence checking was disabled, confluence property is unknown.

The model with the check results has been written to "controllercheck/mdd/disabled_evts.xxxN.out.cif.real".
