CONCLUSION:
    [OK] The specification has bounded response:
    
        - No transitions are possible for uncontrollable events.
        - No transitions are possible for controllable events.

    [ERROR] The specification is NOT non-blocking under control.
    [OK] The specification has finite response.
    [OK] The specification has confluence.

The model with the check results has been written to "controllercheck/mdd/disabled_evts.BCFN.out.cif.real".
