Checking for bounded response...
Computing reachable states...
Reachable states: p.loc1 and not p.v [initial states predicate]
Forward reachability: iteration 1.
Reachable states: p.loc1 and not p.v -> not p.v [forward reach with edge: (event: a) (guard: p.loc1) (assignments: p.v := p.v, p := p.loc2)]
Reachable states: not p.v -> p.loc2 or not p.v [forward reach with edge: (event: b) (guard: p.loc1) (assignments: p.v := not p.v, p := p.loc2)]
Forward reachability: iteration 2.
Reachable states: p.loc2 or not p.v [fixed point].

Computing bound for uncontrollable events...
Bounded response check round 1 (states before round: p.loc2 or not p.v).
Bounded response check round 2 (states before round: p.loc1 and not p.v).

Computing bound for controllable events...
Bounded response check round 1 (states before round: p.loc2 or not p.v).

Bounded response check completed.

Checking for finite response...

Iteration 1.
    The following events have been encountered in a controllable-event loop of automaton p:
        (c), which is not controllable unconnectable.

Iteration 2.
    The following events have been encountered in a controllable-event loop of automaton p:
        (c), which is not controllable unconnectable.

Checking for confluence...

Skippable event pairs:
    (a, c), (b, c)

CONCLUSION:
    [ERROR] The specification does NOT have bounded response:
    
        - An infinite sequence of transitions is possible for uncontrollable events.
        - An infinite sequence of transitions is possible for controllable events.

    [ERROR] The specification may NOT have finite response:
    
        At least one controllable-event loop was found.
        The following events might still occur in a controllable-event loop:
            - c

    [ERROR] The specification may NOT have confluence:
    
        Confluence of the following event pair could not be decided:
            (a, b)
