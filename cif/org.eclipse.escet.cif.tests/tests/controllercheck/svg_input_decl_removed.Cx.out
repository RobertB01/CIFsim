Prepare for the checks...
Analyzing automaton "p"...
    Initialize the automaton data for event "p.c"...
    Process edges from location "the location of automaton "p""...

Checking for confluence...

CONCLUSION:
    Finite response checking was disabled, finite response property is unknown.
    [OK] The specification has confluence.
