\chapter{Introduction}
CIF is a declarative modeling language for the specification of discrete
event, timed, and hybrid systems as a collection of synchronizing automata.
The CIF tooling supports the entire development process of controllers,
including among others specification, supervisory controller synthesis,
simulation-based validation and visualization, verification, real-time
testing, and code generation.

CIF is one of the tools of the Eclipse ESCET\textsuperscript{\texttrademark{}}
project~\cite{Eclipse:ESCET}.

The Eclipse ESCET project, including the CIF language and toolset, is
currently in the \emph{Incubation Phase}~\cite{Eclipse:Incubation}.

This report is organized as follows. The notations and conventions used in
this document are explained in Chapter~\ref{ch:notations-conventions},
Chapter~\ref{ch:cif} describes the CIF metamodel, and

For the CIF language, arrows colored in red are containments, but should
be interpreted semantically as references. That is, in order to allow
wrapping expressions and types to be used, they are containments instead of
references. See also Section~\ref{sec:scoping}.

\chapter{CIF metamodel}\label{ch:cif}

The CIF metamodel consists of the following packages:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \emph{cif} package: includes component structure and component
        definition/instantiation (Section~\ref{cifpkg:cif} at
        page~\pageref{cifpkg:cif}),
    \item \emph{declarations} sub-package: includes CIF declarations,
        including among others events and variables
        (Section~\ref{cifpkg:declarations} at
        page~\pageref{cifpkg:declarations}),
    \item \emph{automata} sub-package: includes automata, the basic components
        of CIF models (Section~\ref{cifpkg:automata} at
        page~\pageref{cifpkg:automata}),
    \item \emph{types} sub-package: includes CIF types
        (Section~\ref{cifpkg:types} at page~\pageref{cifpkg:types}),
    \item \emph{expressions} sub-package: includes CIF expressions
        (Section~\ref{cifpkg:expressions} at
        page~\pageref{cifpkg:expressions}),
    \item \emph{functions} sub-package: includes internal and external
        user-defined CIF functions (Section~\ref{cifpkg:functions} at
        page~\pageref{cifpkg:functions}),
    \item \emph{cifsvg} sub-package: includes CIF/SVG I/O declarations
        (Section~\ref{cifpkg:cifsvg} at page~\pageref{cifpkg:cifsvg}),
        and
    \item \emph{print} sub-package: includes print I/O declarations
        (Section~\ref{cifpkg:print} at page~\pageref{cifpkg:print}),
        and
    \item \emph{position} package: position information
        (Section~\ref{positionpkg:position} at
        page~\pageref{positionpkg:position}).
\end{itemize}

The class diagrams are presented and described in the respective sections
below.

Note that the \textit{position} package is not actually part of the CIF
metamodel. It is actually part of the \textit{position} metamodel, but it is
used by the CIF metamodel to represent position information. As such, the
documentation for the \textit{position} package is included in this document,
for completeness. All CIF classes directly or indirectly derive from
\positionclass{PositionObject}.


\section{Scoping}\label{sec:scoping}

\subsection{Reference wrapping}\label{sec:ref-wrapping}

One of the features of CIF is that pretty much anything in the entire
specification can be referenced from anywhere in the specification. This
is however complicated by the existence of a component
definition/instantiation mechanism.

\begin{figure}[!ht]
  \centering
  \subfloat[The model]{
    \label{fig:wrapping-pre-model}
    \includegraphics[width=0.45\textwidth]{figures/wrapping_pre_model.pdf}
  }
  \hfill
  \subfloat[The reference expression]{
    \label{fig:wrapping-pre-expr}
    \includegraphics[width=0.45\textwidth]{figures/wrapping_pre_expr.pdf}
  }
  \caption{Wrapping expression example: situation before.}
  \label{fig:wrapping-pre}
\end{figure}

Take a look at Figure~\ref{fig:wrapping-pre-model}. It shows a CIF model with
a component definition \texttt{A}, which contains a location \texttt{x}. This
component definition is instantiated twice, once as \texttt{a1}, and once as
\texttt{a2}. Finally, there is a component \texttt{b}, which refers to
location \texttt{x} of component \texttt{a1}. The reference
is written in the CIF textual syntax.

Figure~\ref{fig:wrapping-pre-expr} shows the corresponding instance of
metamodel classes that is generated by the compiler to represent the
\texttt{a1.x} text. Instead of just generating a reference to an instance
of the \cifclass{Location} class, an expression is used. An instance of the
\cifclass{LocationExpression} class is wrapped in an instance of
the \cifclass{CompInstWrapExpression} class, which also references an
instance of the \cifclass{ComponentInst} class.

What we see here is a direct representation of the textual syntax, as we
reference location \texttt{x} via component instantiation \texttt{a1}. We
need to keep track
of references via component instantiations. If we were to only generate an
instance of the \cifclass{LocationExpression} class, or just use a direct
reference to an instance of the \cifclass{Location} class, we would no
longer be able to distinguish between location \texttt{x} in component
\texttt{a1}, and location \texttt{x} in component \texttt{a2}.

\begin{figure}[!ht]
  \centering
  \subfloat[The model]{
    \label{fig:wrapping-post-model}
    \includegraphics[width=0.45\textwidth]{figures/wrapping_post_model.pdf}
  }
  \hfill
  \subfloat[The reference expression]{
    \label{fig:wrapping-post-expr}
    \includegraphics[width=0.45\textwidth]{figures/wrapping_post_expr.pdf}
  }
  \caption{Wrapping expression example: situation after.}
  \label{fig:wrapping-post}
\end{figure}

Figure~\ref{fig:wrapping-post-model} shows the model after elimination of
component definition/instantiation. We see that components instantiations
\texttt{a1} and \texttt{a2} are replaced by components \texttt{a1} and
\texttt{a2}, which are essentially equal to the body of component definition
\texttt{A}. As such, we now have two locations \texttt{x}, one in component
\texttt{a1}, and one in component \texttt{a2}. The text to refer to location
\texttt{x} of component \texttt{a1}, as used in component \texttt{b}, is
still \texttt{a1.x}.

Figure~\ref{fig:wrapping-post-expr} shows the corresponding reference
expression. It is no longer necessary to use a wrapping expression, as we
can refer to location \texttt{x} in component a1 directly, as it is a real
location, not one that we can get multiple versions of due to instantiation.
As such, there is no confusion about which location we mean by that reference
expression.

Note that wrapping does not only apply to references via component
instantiations, but also to references via component parameters.
Also, it does not just apply to expressions references, but also to type
references. See also the \cifclass{CompInstWrapType},
\cifclass{CompParamWrapType}, \cifclass{CompInstWrapExpression}, and
\cifclass{CompParamWrapExpression} classes.

From this we can conclude that reference expressions, reference types, and
their wrapping variants, are necessary to keep track of the component
instantiations and component parameters via which we reference certain
objects. That is, we need to correctly capture all of the information contained
in the textual representations of references, in our metamodel representation.
This is for instance needed to be able to correctly reroute references during
the elimination of component definition/instantiation. After that elimination
step however, wrapping expressions and wrapping types are no longer present.
References do remain expressions, and as such, in the example, an instance
of the \cifclass{LocationExpression} is contained, instead of a direct
reference to an instance of the \cifclass{Location} class. Such containments
are colored in red in the metamodel, as already mentioned in
Chapter~\ref{ch:notations-conventions}.


\subsection{Scoping rules}

As previously mentioned in Section~\ref{sec:ref-wrapping}, one of the features
of CIF is that pretty much anything in the entire specification can be
referenced from anywhere in the specification. This is however complicated by
the existence of a component definition/instantiation mechanism, which caused
a need for reference wrapping.

This section explains the scoping rules of CIF.
Figure~\ref{fig:scoping-visibility} shows an example CIF specification. The
rectangles in the figure indicate components and component definitions. The
outer rectangle (the dashed one), indicates the entire specification. The
text fragments are written in a slightly simplified version of the CIF textual
syntax. In the remainder of this section, the example is used to explain
the scoping rules.

\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \import{figures/}{scoping_visibility.tex}
  \caption{Scoping and visibility example.}
  \label{fig:scoping-visibility}
\end{figure}

The first thing to note about the figure are the different colors. They
indicate the different scopes of the specification. The outer-most scope (the
red scope) is the specification scope. We walk the containment hierarchy
downwards until we hit a component definition. From there, we start a new
scope, and repeat the process. That is, specifications and component
definitions start a new scope. The idea is that component definitions are
definitions, and as such we can't refer to objects in component definitions
directly. If we were to be able to reference objects in component definitions
directly, and there would not be any instance of such a component definition,
or there would be multiple instances, to what would we be referring? So, to
solve this ambiguity, only once we instantiate a component definition, can we
refer to objects within that definition (via component instantiation reference
wrapping expressions for instance).

An example of this is component
instantiation \texttt{c:} \texttt{C()} in component \texttt{a}. In component
\texttt{a}, in the red scope, we can't directly reference objects from
component definition \texttt{C}, as those objects are in the green scope. Once
we have \texttt{c}, we can use it to refer to objects in \texttt{C}, such
as \texttt{c.b}. In fact, \texttt{c.b.a.a.x} refers to location \texttt{x}
(black scope) in component \texttt{a.a} (black scope) in component definition
\texttt{B}, via component instantiations \texttt{c} (red scope to green scope)
and \texttt{b} (green scope to black scope).

Note how a component definition itself is part of the enclosing scope, while
the parameters are part of the new scope that is introduced by the component
definition. That is, the parameter cannot be referenced directly from the
enclosing scope. If we look at component definition \texttt{K}, we see that
component parameter \texttt{c} is part of the new blue scope. The type of
component parameter \texttt{c} is component \texttt{C}, which is resolved
in the enclosing scope (the red scope).

Within a single scope (single color in the figure), anything can be referenced
directly. For instance, in component \texttt{a} (red scope), references
\texttt{b.x} and \texttt{b.y} refer to locations in automaton \texttt{b},
which is part of the same red scope. Furthermore, component definition
\texttt{P} (from component \texttt{i}) can be instantiated directly in
component \texttt{a}, as both are in the red scope.

In general, anything within the same scope can be referenced directly, as can
anything from ancestors scopes (the parent scope, the parent of the parent
scope, etc). An example of the latter is \texttt{d.x}
in an invariant of component \texttt{C.B.a} (in the black scope), which refers
to location \texttt{C.d.x} of automaton \texttt{C.d}, in the green parent
scope. The only two ways to reference things in component definitions
that the reference itself is not a part of, are via component
instantiations and via component parameters. For an example of the latter,
see invariant \texttt{inv c.d.x} in component definition \texttt{K}.

Note that it is not allowed to instantiate component definitions which, in the
instantiation context, can only be referenced via another component
instantiation or via a component parameter. That is, it is not allowed to
instantiate a component definition X, declared inside other component
definition Y, from outside Y. Conceptually, in an instantiated component,
there are no component definitions.

Also, it is not allowed to refer to a parameter of a component definition,
via component instantiations or via other component parameters. Once again,
conceptually, in an instantiated component, there are no parameters.

For user-defined functions, it is not allowed to refer to anything inside a
function (parameters etc) from outside the function. The other way around, from
inside a function, it is not allowed to refer to variables, locations, events,
components, component definitions, etc. Objects with constant values (such as
constants etc) may be referenced from inside functions, as may types (type
declarations, enumerations, etc).

The scoping rules for tuple fields are special. See the
\cifclass{ProjectionExpression} class for further details.


\subsection{Visibility}

Within the metamodel, the scoping rules are enough. However, in the CIF
textual syntax, the concept of \emph{visibility} is important as well.

If we look at Figure~\ref{fig:scoping-visibility}, we see that relative
references to objects that are `in scope' are possible. For instance, in
component \texttt{a}, there is a relative reference to \texttt{b.x}.
Reference \texttt{c.b.a.a.x} is a relative reference as well, even though it
uses some component instantiations to reach other scopes. Relative references
refer to objects in the same sub-scope or deeper sub-scopes, possibly via
references to other scopes.

Relative references are also possible to objects defined at higher levels,
as for instance shown by discrete variable \texttt{C.B.a.a.v0}, which has type
\texttt{t}. This type \texttt{t} is defined one sub-scope above, in
\texttt{C.B.a}.

The other discrete variables in that same automaton, discrete variables
\texttt{v1} and
\texttt{v2}, also have type \texttt{t} as their type, but refer to different
types \texttt{t}. Since only one object with a given name can be visible in
a scope or sub-scope, types \texttt{t} (in the specification scope) and
\texttt{C.B.t} are not visible in automaton \texttt{C.B.a.a}. They are however
`in scope', as they are type declarations in the same scope or in ancestor
scopes.

To be able to refer to objects that are in scope, but are \emph{hidden} by
other declarations of the same name, absolute references can be used. There
are two variants: scope absolute references and specification absolute
references. The type \texttt{.t} of discrete variable \texttt{v1} is a scope
absolute
reference. The reference starts with a single dot (\texttt{.}) and is then
relative to the root of the current scope (the black scope). The type
\texttt{\^{}t} of discrete variable \texttt{v2} is a specification absolute
reference. The reference starts with a caret (\texttt{\^}) and is then
relative to the root of the current specification (the red scope).

Note that functions, similar to components, introduce a sub-scope.

Note that edges with a receive communication that receives a value in a
`receive variable', introduce a sub-scope. This scope has only one declaration,
the `receive variable'. This kind of sub-scope is special in the sense that
it has no name, and as such the `receive variable' can't be reached using a
relative reference, from outside that sub-scope. In fact, `receive variables'
are only in scope for the the updates of their edge. Note that as for all
scopes, `receive variables' may hide other objects with the same name, from
parent scopes.
