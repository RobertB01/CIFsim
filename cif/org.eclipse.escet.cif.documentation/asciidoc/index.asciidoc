CIF is a declarative modeling language for the specification of discrete
event, timed, and hybrid systems as a collection of synchronizing automata.
The CIF tooling supports the entire development process of controllers,
including among others specification, supervisory controller synthesis,
simulation-based validation and visualization, verification, real-time
testing, and code generation.

CIF is one of the tools of the Eclipse ESCET(TM) project. Visit the
link:https://eclipse.org/escet[project website] for downloads,
installation instructions, source code, general tool usage information,
information on how to contribute, and more.

[WARNING]
====
The Eclipse ESCET project, including the CIF language and toolset,
is currently in the
link:https://wiki.eclipse.org/Development_Resources/Process_Guidelines/What_is_Incubation[Incubation Phase].
