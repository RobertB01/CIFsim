== Synthesis-based engineering

CIF supports synthesis-based engineering (SBE), an engineering approach to design and implement supervisory controllers.
The engineering approach combines model-based engineering with computer-aided design to produce correct-by-construction controllers.
It does so by automating as many steps as possible in the development process.

Supervisory controller synthesis is a main element of synthesis-based engineering, and a key feature of CIF.
It involves the automatic generation of supervisory controller models.
Implementation of the controller is achieved through (implementation language) code generation, improving speed and reducing the number of errors introduced at this stage.
Combined, they allow engineers to focus on _what_ the controller should do, rather than _how_ it should do it, and how this is to be implemented.

Synthesis-based engineering has many more benefits.
As the engineering approach uses well-defined models, designs can be discussed, analyzed, model-checked, or simulated.
That allows finding and correcting issues early in the development process, rather than during later stages where correcting them is more costly.
It also supports a comprehensive modular design and efficient incremental engineering.
Ultimately, this reduces development time and improves the quality of the resulting supervisory controllers.
