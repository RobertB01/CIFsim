CIF is a declarative modeling language for the specification of discrete event, timed, and hybrid systems as a collection of synchronizing automata.
The CIF tooling supports the entire development process of controllers, including among others specification, supervisory controller synthesis, simulation-based validation and visualization, verification, real-time testing, and code generation.
Combined they enable a synthesis-based engineering approach to efficiently and cost-effectively design and implement high-quality controllers.

CIF is one of the tools of the Eclipse ESCET(TM) project.
Visit the link:https://eclipse.org/escet/{escet-website-version}[project website] for downloads, installation instructions, source code, general tool usage information, information on how to contribute, and more.

[WARNING]
====
The Eclipse ESCET project, including the CIF language and toolset, is currently in the link:https://www.eclipse.org/projects/handbook/#starting-incubation[Incubation Phase].
