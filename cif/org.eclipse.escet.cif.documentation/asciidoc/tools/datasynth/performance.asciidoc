[[tools-datasynth-performance]]
== Performance

Obviously, the actual model that is used has a large impact as well.
More variables often leads to longer synthesis times.
However, the predicates that are used may also significantly impact performance.

Try to use state/event exclusion requirement invariants instead of requirement automata with a single location and self loops.
Also, try to avoid an event-based modeling style, and use a data-based modeling style instead, if possible.

The following <<tools-datasynth-options,options>> have an effect on the performance of data-based synthesis:

[cols="5,15,15,20,40",options="header"]
|===
| Kind
| Option
| Section
| Effect
| Choose

| Input
| State requirement invariant enforcement
| <<tools-datasynth-state-req-invs>>
| Impacts the up-front effort, size of the controlled behavior, number of iterations to reach fixed points, and the post-synthesis effort
| Complex trade-off between different effects, depends on the model

| Input
| Edge granularity
| <<tools-datasynth-edge-granularity>>
| Impacts the size of the edge representations, size of the controlled behavior, number of iterations to reach fixed points, and the post-synthesis effort
| Choose the best representation, depends on the model

| Output
| BDD output mode
| <<tools-datasynth-supervisor-bdd>>
| Representation of BDDs in the output model
| Use `nodes` output variant for best performance

| Output
| BDD predicate simplify
| <<tools-datasynth-simplification>>
| Potentially smaller BDDs in the output
| Enable for smaller output, although simplification itself also takes time

| Order
| BDD initial variable ordering
| <<tools-datasynth-var-order-initial-ordering>>
| Better order for smaller BDD representations
| Choose the best ordering, depends on the model, (reversed) model/sorted usually good choices, custom order allows for best performance

| Better order for smaller BDD representations
| Enable for automatic ordering

| Order
| BDD sliding window size
| <<tools-datasynth-var-order-auto-var-ordering>>
| Better order for smaller BDD representations
| Larger windows might allow for more optimization, but take more time

| Order
| BDD advanced variable ordering
| <<tools-datasynth-var-order-adv-config>>
| Better order for smaller BDD representations
| Choose the best ordering, depends on the model

| Order
| Edge order for backward reachability
| <<tools-datasynth-edge-order>>
| Better order for less computations and smaller BDD representations

| Better order for less computations and smaller BDD representations
| Enable to dynamically determine the order in which edges are considered, for better performance

| Library
| BDD library initial node table size
| <<tools-datasynth-stats>>
| More storage for less resizes
| Increase size for less resizes, at the cost of less memory locality

| Library
| BDD library operation cache size/ratio
| <<tools-datasynth-op-cache>>
| Increase cache for less computations
| Enable, larger costs more memory, larger leads to less memory locality, size/ratio depends on model

| Disable for better performance

| Warnings
| Plants referencing requirements warnings
| <<tools-datasynth-early-prob-detect>>
| Warning for plants that reference requirement state
| Disable for better performance

The first column categorizes the different options a bit, for different kind of options.
The second column lists the different options.
The third column indicates in which section of the data-based synthesis tool documentation you can find more information about that option.
The fourth column indicates the effect of the option.
The fifth column indicates what to choose for the option, for best performance, although a trade-off may be involved.
