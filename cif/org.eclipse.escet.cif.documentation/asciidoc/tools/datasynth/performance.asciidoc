[[tools-datasynth-performance]]
== Performance

There are quite a few factors that influence the performance of data-based synthesis.
Here are some of those factors, which affect both the time it takes to complete a synthesis and the memory that is used for it:

* Obviously, the actual model that is used has a large impact.
A model with more variables often has to longer synthesis time and requires more memory.
However, the predicates that are used may also significantly impact performance.

* The modeling style used when modeling the plants and requirements can also have a significant impact on the performance.
See for instance <<sbe-in-practice-advanced-performance,these suggestions>>.

* Several options of the data-based synthesis tool impact its performance.
A list of such option is given below.

[[tools-datasynth-performance-out-of-memory]]
If you run out of memory, here are some potential solutions:

* Increase the memory available to the synthesis tool.
For more information, see the page of the Eclipse ESCET general toolkit documentation on link:https://eclipse.dev/escet/{escet-deploy-folder-name}/performance/index.html[resolving performance and memory problems].

* Decrease the <<tools-datasynth-op-cache,size of the BDD operation caches>>, to make sure more memory remains available for the actual data used during synthesis.
While decreasing the size of caches may increase the synthesis time, it is better to be able to synthesize a supervisor in a longer time than to not be able to synthesize it at all.
