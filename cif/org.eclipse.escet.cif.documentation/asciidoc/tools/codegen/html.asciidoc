[[tools-codegen-chapter-html]]
== HTML code generation

WARNING: HTML code generation is currently an experimental feature.

indexterm:[CIF code generator,HTML]
indexterm:[HTML,code generation]
The <<tools-codegen-chapter-index,CIF code generator>> can generate HTML from a CIF specification.
For a CIF specification, a single HTML file is generated, which can be opened in a browser.
In this way, the CIF specification can be executed in a browser, similar to using the <<tools-cifsim-chapter-index,CIF simulator>> to simulate the specification.

The HTML file that is generated contains JavaScript code that is used to execute the CIF specification (see <<tools-codegen-chapter-javascript,JavaScript code generation>> for more information).
The HTML file also includes a simple UI, to control the execution.
Furthermore, the SVG images <<tools-cifsim-output-svgviz-chapter-cifsvg,coupled to the specification>> are included.
The images are animated based on the state of the CIF model, if the specification contains <<tools-cifsim-output-svgviz-chapter-svgout,CIF/SVG output mappings>>.
The images can be clicked to interact with the specification and influence the execution, if the specification contains <<tools-cifsim-input-svg-chapter-svgin,CIF/SVG input mappings>>.

It is assumed the reader of this page is familiar with the general information of the <<tools-codegen-chapter-index,CIF code generator>> tool.
This page describes specific information applicable only to HTML code generation.

=== HTML page

Generated HTML files can be opened in any modern browser.
The HTML files may not function correctly when opened in the browser embedded in the Eclipse ESCET IDE.
They should therefore be opened in an external browser.

==== Areas

The HTML page primarily consists of two areas:

* In the upper area, the name of the model and the SVG images are displayed.
* In the lower area, several buttons, configuration options, and a log panel are present.

The lower area can be resized.
If the <<tools-codegen-html-log-panel,log panel>> is not hidden, a small triangular marker appears at the bottom-right corner of the upper area, just above the _Hide_ button.
Press and drag the marker up or down to resize the lower area.

==== Execution

When the HTML file is opened in a browser, the execution start directly.
Several buttons are present to control the execution:

* To stop the execution, press the _Stop_ button.
* To continue the execution after stopping it, press the _Start_ button.
* The execution can be reset to the start state by pressing the _Reset_ button.
Resetting the execution also stops it.

==== Visualization

If the specification features SVG images, these are displayed in the upper area.
As the execution progresses, the images are updated based on the state of the CIF specification being executed.
The visualization can be influenced using the following options:

* **Frequency:**
A slides is present to set the frequency at which the code is executed.
For instance, a frequency of 60 Hz means that the JavaScript code generated for the CIF specification is executed 60 times per second.
+
Decreasing the frequency reduces the CPU usage of the browser, and makes animations less fluent.
Conversely, increasing the frequency makes animations more fluent and accurate, but increases CPU usage.
+
The default frequency is 60 Hz.

* **Image visibility:**
In case the CIF specification is connected to multiple SVG images, a checkbox is present for each image.
+
Checking a checkbox ensures that the corresponding image is shown.
Unchecking a checkbox hides the corresponding image.
+
By default all images are shown.

==== Interaction

If the specification features CIF/SVG input mappings, the SVG images become interactive.
Clicking an interactive element of an SVG image influences the execution of the specification.

Elements of the SVG images that are interactive get a red outline when hovering over them.
The mouse pointer then also changes, to indicate that they can be clicked.

Clicking an interactive SVG element has no effect while the execution is stopped.

[[tools-codegen-html-log-panel]]
==== Log panel

In the lower area also a log panel is displayed.
It provides a log of the current execution, such as which transitions are executed.
Upon resetting the execution, the log is cleared.

The log panel can be hidden by pressing the _Hide_ button.
Once it is hidden, it can be shown again by clicking the _Show_ button.

The log can be downloaded as a text file by pressing the _Download log_ button.
The filename of the downloaded log includes the model name, and a timestamp, such that different logs can be easily distinguished.

==== Settings

The settings menu can be shown by pressing the _Settings_ button.
Pressing the button again hides the settings menu.
The following settings can be configured in the settings menu:

* _Log states_:
Whether to log all states that are reached.
Is disabled by default.

* _Log transitions_:
Whether to log event transitions that are executed.
Is enabled by default.
