== Plot visualizer

indexterm:[CIF simulator,plot visualizer]
indexterm:[plot visualizer]
indexterm:[simulation output,plot visualizer]
For models with variables, especially continuous ones, it may be useful to be able to observe how their values change, as time progresses during simulation.
The _plot visualizer_ can be used for that exact purpose.
The plot visualizer can create graphical plots, where the x-axis represents the values of variable `time`, and the y-axis represents values of the variables being plotted.
Here is an example screenshot of the visualizer:

indexterm:[plot visualizer,enable]
indexterm:[plot visualizer,disable]

[[tools-cifsim-output-plotviz-option]]
Plot visualization is disabled by default.
It can be enabled using the _Plot visualization_ option (_Output: Plot visualization_ category).

=== Variables

The plot visualizer can plot the values of the following variables (officially 'state objects'):

* The state variables, which includes the discrete variables and the continuous variables.

* The derivatives of the continuous variables.
This does not include the derivative of variable `time`.

* The algebraic variables.

Only variables of type `bool`, `int` (with or without ranges), or `real` can be plotted.
For variables with a boolean type, value `false` is represented by `0`, and value `true` is represented by `1`.

indexterm:[plot visualizer,filtering]

[[tools-cifsim-output-plotviz-filtering]]
=== Filtering

By default, if plot visualization is enabled, all variables (officially 'state objects') that can be plotted are plotted.
The one exception is variable `time`, which is excluded by default, as it already represents the x-axis.
That is, variables are plotted against time.
Using the _Plot visualization filters_ option (_Output: Plot visualization_ category), the state objects can be filtered.
The _Plot visualization filters_ option only has effect if plot visualization is enabled, using the _Plot visualization_ option.

As value for the option, comma separated _filters_ should be supplied.
Each filter specifies one or more state objects.
The absolute names of the objects are used.
That is, for an automaton `a`, with a variable `x`, the absolute name of the variable object is `a.x`.
If CIF textual syntax keyword are used as names for events (such as `plant`), then they must be escaped in `.cif` files (`$plant`).
For filters however, all escape characters (`$`) in the names are ignored.
The `+*+` character can be used as wildcard, to indicate zero or more characters.
If a filter doesn't match any of the state objects of the CIF model, a warning is printed to the console.
A warning is also printed if the entire state is filtered out.

By default, filters include matching state objects.
Filters may however be preceded by a `-` character, turning them into exclusion filters, which exclude matching states objects rather than including them.
Filters are processed in the order they are specified, allowing for alternating additions and removals.
If a filter does not result in the addition/removal of any state objects to/from the filter result, a warning is printed to the console.

As an example, option value `+a.*,-a.b*,a.bc*+` consists of three filters:
`+a.*+`, `+-a.b*+`, and `+a.bc*+`.
The first filter indicates that state objects whose absolute names start with `a.` are to be included.
The second filter indicates that from those matching state objects, the state objects whose absolute names start with `+a.b*+` are to be excluded.
To that result, the third filter adds those state objects whose absolute names start with `+a.bc*+`.
For instance, if a specification contains state objects `time`, `a.a`, `a.b` `a.bb`, `a.bc`, `a.b.c`, `a.bc`, `a.bcc`, and `a.bcd`, the result of the three filters is that the following state objects are displayed: `a.a`, `a.bc`, `a.bc`, `a.bcc`, and `a.bcd`.

The default option value (filter) is `+*,-time+`.

indexterm:[plot visualizer,multiple]

=== Multiple plot visualizers

By default, only one visualizer is shown.
However, using the _Plot visualization filters_ option (_Output: Plot visualization_ category), it is possible to specify that multiple visualizers should be used.
The option allows for filtering of the state objects, as described above.
However, such filters can be separated by semicolons, to specify the filters per visualizer.

As an example, consider option value `time,a.x;b.y`.
This results in two plot visualizers.
The first one displays state objects `time` and `a.x`, while the second one displays state object `b.y`.

indexterm:[plot visualizer,modes]

[[tools-cifsim-output-plotviz-mode]]
=== Plot visualization modes

There are two plot visualization modes:

* Live plotting.
In this mode, the plots are shown at the start of the simulation, and are continuously updated as new data becomes available during simulation.

* Postponed plotting.
In this mode, the plots are shown after the simulation has <<tools-cifsim-chapter-termination,ended>>.

Which plot visualization mode to use, can be configured using the _Plot visualization mode_ option (_Output: Plot visualization_ category).
Using that option it is possible to explicitly choose one of the modes.
By default, an automatic mode is used, which chooses between live and postponed mode, as follows:

[cols=3*,options="header"]
|===
| <<tools-cifsim-input-chapter-index,Input mode>> vs <<tools-cifsim-output-chapter-realtime,real-time simulation>>
| Real-time enabled
| Real-time disabled

| <<tools-cifsim-input-chapter-console>> (pure interactive)
| live
| live

| <<tools-cifsim-input-chapter-console>> (<<tools-cifsim-input-chapter-semi-automatic,semi-automatic>>)
| live
| postponed

| <<tools-cifsim-input-chapter-gui>> (pure interactive)
| live
| live

| <<tools-cifsim-input-chapter-gui>> (<<tools-cifsim-input-chapter-semi-automatic,semi-automatic>>)
| live
| postponed

| <<tools-cifsim-input-chapter-automatic>>
| live
| postponed

| <<tools-cifsim-input-chapter-trace>>
| live
| postponed

| <<tools-cifsim-input-svg-chapter-index>>
| live
| postponed
|===

When doing a non real-time simulation, using a non-interactive input mode leads to as fast as possible simulation, where a lot of data points are calculated in a short amount of time.
If live plotting mode is then enabled, this floods the visualizer with so much data that it can't keep up.
The effect is a non-responsive user interface.
While the automatic default can thus be overridden using the option, it is generally not recommended.

indexterm:[plot visualizer,range]

[[tools-cifsim-output-plotviz-range]]
=== Plot visualization range

For simulations that span longer periods of (model) time, there may be too much data to display, for the limited width of the time axis (x-axis).
To keep the plot useful, the range of time values to display on the x-axis can be configured using the _Plot visualization range_ option (_Output: Plot visualization_ category).

By default, only the `50` most recent time units are displayed.
That is, if the current model time is `120`, then the plot only shows the values of the variables from time `70` to time `120`.
Using the option, the length of the range can configured to any other positive value.
The option can also be used to set the range to infinite, to display the values of the variables during the entire simulation, from time `0` to the current model time.

For long running simulations, with lots variables, using an infinite range can lead to large numbers of data points, which can have a significant effect on performance.
This applies especially for live plotting mode.

indexterm:[plot visualizer,data points]

[[tools-cifsim-output-plotviz-data]]
=== Data points

This section describes which data points are visualized.
For most users, this will be of little interest, as it essentially works as you would expect.

The plot visualizer adds data points (a `time` value and a value of a variable at that time) for all variables, for the following <<tools-cifsim-traces-state,states>>:

* The initial state of the simulation.

* The start state of every time transition.

* <<tools-cifsim-output-realtime-frames,Intermediate states>> of time transitions, only if real-time simulation is enabled.

* Trajectory data points of time transitions, only if real-time simulation is disabled.

* The end state of every time transition.

For real-time simulation, the amount of model time between two intermediate states is the <<tools-cifsim-output-realtime-delta,model time delta>>, and can be influenced using the <<tools-cifsim-output-realtime-framerate,frame rate>> and <<tools-cifsim-output-realtime-simspeed,simulation speed>>.

For non real-time simulation, the trajectory data points are determined by the <<tools-cifsim-solver-chapter-basics-int,ODE solver integrator>>, and can be influenced using the <<tools-cifsim-solver-chapter-options,integration options>>, as well as the <<tools-cifsim-solver-chapter-options-outstep,fixed output step size>> option.

indexterm:[plot visualizer,trajectory data relation]

[[tools-cifsim-output-plotviz-trajdata-relation]]
=== Relation to trajectory data output

The plot visualizer can be used for simple plotting.
It can be customized a bit through options, as described above.
However, the level of customization is somewhat limited.
For instance, the appearance can not be customized.
This is intentional.

If further customization is required, use the <<tools-cifsim-output-chapter-trajdata,trajectory data output component>> instead.
It allows saving the data to a file, for further processing with external tools, such as link:http://www.r-project.org/[R].

Such post processing is then performed after the simulation has <<tools-cifsim-chapter-termination,ended>>.
A benefit of the plot visualizer, is that it allows live plotting mode, without the need of post processing, and which can be enabled with little effort.
The plot visualizer is meant to be used only to get a basic understanding of how values of variables change as time progresses.

indexterm:[plot visualizer,save plot image]

[[tools-cifsim-output-plotviz-trajdata-save]]
=== Saving a plot image

The plot visualizer can export the currently visible plot to several different image formats.
To export the image, first make sure that the plot visualizer has the focus.
Then select menu:File[Save As...] to open the _Save plot as_ dialog.
Alternatively, right click the plot itself, and choose menu:Save As...[] from the popup menu, to open the _Save plot as_ dialog.
In the dialog, specify the file name of the exported image.
Click btn:[OK] to confirm and continue.

A second dialog appears, in which the size of the exported image can be specified.
By default, the current size of the visualizer is used.
A custom size can be entered.
The width and height need to specified in pixels, separated by a `x` character.
For instance, for a width of `640` pixels and a height of `480` pixels, enter `640x480` into the dialog.
Click btn:[OK] to confirm and to actually export the image.

The following link:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raster_graphics[raster image] formats are supported:

* link:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portable_Network_Graphics[Portable Network Graphics] (`+*.png+`)

* link:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JPEG[JPEG] (`+*.jpg+`)

* link:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphics_Interchange_Format[Graphics Interchange Format] (`+*.gif+`)

The image format that is used to export the image, is derived from the file extension that is used.
For each of the supported file formats, the allowed file names (with file extensions) are indicated above (between parentheses).

After the image is exported, the workspace is refreshed to show that new image file, if the image was saved in a project that is visible in the _Project Explorer_ tab or _Package Explorer_ tab.

In order for the export to succeed, data points must be available for at least two time values.

indexterm:[plot visualizer,undo]
indexterm:[plot visualizer,reset]

=== Undo/reset

It is possible to go back in time, by <<tools-cifsim-input-history-reset-undo,undoing>> one or more transitions, or by <<tools-cifsim-input-history-reset-undo,resetting>> the simulation.

If one or more transitions are undone, data for all time points that are then suddenly in the future, are removed.
More precisely, all data for time points added for time transitions that have been undone, are removed.

If the simulation is reset, the entire plot is cleared.
