== Interactive GUI input mode

indexterm:[input mode,interactive GUI input mode]
indexterm:[interactive GUI input mode]
In the interactive GUI input mode, the simulator interactively asks the user to choose the transitions to take, etc.
Choices are presented using a GUI (Graphical User Interface).
The user makes choices via the GUI as well.

=== Layout

The following is an example of the simulator interactively asking the user to choose a possible transition:

image::{tools-imgsdir}/cifsim/input/interactive_gui_basic.png[]
The events of the system are vertically listed, in alphabetical order, with event `tau` at the end, just before the menu:time delay[], and menu:reset[] and menu:undo[].
If there are too many elements to fit vertically, more columns are used.
If things still don't fit, a horizontal scroll bar is shown.

[[tools-cifsim-input-gui-availability]]
=== Availability

Choices for events are only present if the events are interactively chosen.
If they are (semi-)automatically chosen, they are not shown in the GUI.
Similarly, choices for menu:time delay[] are only shown if time transitions or their durations are interactively chosen.
For more information, see the <<tools-cifsim-input-gui-semiauto>> section below.

For event `tau`, the choices are additionally only shown if there is at least one `tau` edge in the specification.

The choice to menu:reset[] the simulation is only shown if <<tools-cifsim-input-history-reset-undo,resetting>> the simulation is enabled.
Similarly, the choice to menu:undo[] transitions is only shown if <<tools-cifsim-input-history-reset-undo,undo>> is enabled.

If none of the choices are to be shown in the GUI, the GUI itself is not shown at all.


=== Buttons

For each element, there are two buttons.
The left button shows the name of the event, or a description of the choice (e.g. menu:time delay[], menu:reset[]), and can be used to quickly choose a transition.
The second button shows an arrow, and can be used to show a popup menu, presenting additional choices.
What exactly is chosen when clicking the button, and what exactly is shown in the popup menu, differs for the different choices.
The sections below provide further details.

If no choice needs to be made at the moment, all buttons are disabled.
If a choice needs to be made, only those buttons that represent active choices are enabled.


=== Styling

For <<tools-cifsim-chapter-env-events,environment>> (non-urgent) events, the label of the left button is italic.
For non-environment (urgent) events, as well as for non-event choices, the label uses a normal font.

Before each element a colored box is shown.
The box is gray while that particular choice is not available.
If choices are available, the box is green for <<lang-tut-extensions-synthesis-evtctrl,controllable>> events, red for <<lang-tut-extensions-synthesis-evtctrl,uncontrollable>> events, blue for other events, and black for everything else (menu:time delay[], menu:reset[], and menu:undo[]).
The text of the left button has the same color as the box.
The colors help to quickly identify elements with possible choices.


=== Labels

Between the buttons, a label may be shown, to provide more details.
When the label is shown, and what text is shown, differs for the different choices.
The sections below provide further details.

In the above image, the system has five events, besides the `tau` event.
The simulator asks the user to choose between a transition for event `Switch.u_on` and a time transition.


=== Choosing an event transition

For an event, the first button makes it possible to quickly choose a transition for that event.
If clicked, the possible transitions are filtered to those for the chosen event, and the <<tools-cifsim-input-chapter-automatic,automatic input component>> is asked to make the actual choice, based on its own configuration.

If multiple transitions are possible for a single event, the number of possible transitions is displayed as label between the two buttons for that event.
The following image shows an example:

image::{tools-imgsdir}/cifsim/input/interactive_gui_event.png[]
In this example, two transitions are possible for event `b2m`.
By clicking the button labeled with `b2m`, the <<tools-cifsim-input-chapter-automatic,automatic input component>> is asked to choose between the two transitions, based on its own configuration.
By clicking the arrow button, a popup menu is shown, showing the two transitions.
The popup menu allows manually choosing which transition to take, by clicking the menu item of the transition you wish to take.


=== Choosing a time transition and duration

The btn:[time delay] button makes it possible to quickly choose the time transition.
By default the maximum allowed delay duration will be used.
This duration is displayed as label between the two buttons, in short form with three significant digits.
By clicking the arrow button, additional options become available.
These options also show the complete durations.
The following image shows an example:

image::{tools-imgsdir}/cifsim/input/interactive_gui_time.png[]

At most `0.30000000000000066` units of time can pass (`0.300` in short form).
The first option is to choose a custom duration.
The second option is to choose that maximum duration, similar to clicking the menu:time delay[] button.
The following image shows the dialog that is presented to the user to enter the custom duration:

image::{tools-imgsdir}/cifsim/input/interactive_gui_duration.png[]

By entering an integer or real number for the duration, that exact amount of time units will pass, after clicking the btn:[OK] button.
If the btn:[Cancel] button is clicked instead, the choice is canceled, and the user is again free to choose between all available choices.


=== Choosing to reset the simulation

The btn:[reset] button makes it possible to <<tools-cifsim-input-history-reset-undo,reset>> the simulation to the initial state.
The popup menu that can be shown by clicking on the arrow button, has only one option, which the same effect as clicking the button.
The following image shows the popup menu:

image::{tools-imgsdir}/cifsim/input/interactive_gui_reset.png[]

=== Choosing to undo some transitions

The btn:[undo] button makes it possible to <<tools-cifsim-input-history-reset-undo,undo>> a single transition, and go back to the state just prior to that transition.
The number of transitions that can be undone, is displayed as label between the two buttons.

Clicking the arrow button shows a popup menu with additional options.
Menu items are present to undo 1 transition, to undo 2 transitions, to undo 3 transitions, etc, for as many transitions as can be undone.
The following image shows an example with two transitions that can be undone:

image::{tools-imgsdir}/cifsim/input/interactive_gui_undo2.png[]

At most 10 such menu items are shown.
If more than 10 transitions can be undone, an additional choice is present, that allows entering a custom number of transitions to undo.
The following image shows an example with 12 transitions that can be undone:

image::{tools-imgsdir}/cifsim/input/interactive_gui_undo12.png[]

Selecting that last option will present the user with a dialog, to select the number of transitions to undo:

image::{tools-imgsdir}/cifsim/input/interactive_gui_undo_count.png[]

The number of transitions needs to be entered as a positive number, within the given range.
Clicking the btn:[OK] button will undo the requested number of transitions.
If the btn:[Cancel] button is clicked instead, the choice is canceled, and the user is again free to choose between all available choices.

indexterm:[interactive GUI input mode,semi-automatic mode]

[[tools-cifsim-input-gui-semiauto]]
=== Semi-automatic mode

By default, in the interactive GUI input mode, the user is asked to choose, even if for instance there is only one possible transition.
Having to choose for every transition can become tiresome.
To reduce the number of situations where a choice is required, the <<tools-cifsim-input-chapter-semi-automatic,semi-automatic>> mode is available.

Choices that are no longer available due to them being automatically chosen by enabling semi-automatic mode, are not shown in the GUI of the interactive GUI input mode.
See also the <<tools-cifsim-input-gui-availability>> section above.

By enabling semi-automatic mode to automatically choose time transitions (option value `time`), while not automatically choosing the delay durations of time transitions (option value `timedur`), time transitions are automatically chosen, but the user is still asked to choose the duration of the time transitions.
For this choice, all non-time choices are disabled, making only the time related choices available.
The effect of the menu:time delay[] button remains the same, i.e. choosing the maximum allowed or available delay.
The popup menu for the time delay also still shows the default options, to choose either a specific custom delay duration, or the maximum duration.

By enabling semi-automatic mode to automatically choose the delay durations of time transitions (option value `timedur`), while not automatically choosing the time transition themselves (option value `time`), the effect of the menu:time delay[] button changes from choosing the time transition with the maximum allowed or available delay, to choosing the time transition and letting the <<tools-cifsim-input-chapter-automatic,automatic input component>> choose the actual delay duration, based on its own configuration.
The popup menu for the time delay then only shows one option, to let the automatic input component choose, identical to the effect of the menu:time delay[] button.


=== Termination

By closing the GUI of the interactive GUI input component, no more interactive choices can be made.
The next time an interactive choice is to be made, simulation <<tools-cifsim-chapter-termination,terminates>>.

While an interactive choice is to be made via the GUI, the red stop button of the Eclipse console does not function.
Once a choice is made, simulation will <<tools-cifsim-chapter-termination,terminate>>.
