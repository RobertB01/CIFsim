[[tools-cifsim-chapter-termination]]
== Terminating the simulator

indexterm:[CIF simulator,termination]
The CIF simulator can terminate for various reasons.
This page explains each of them, as well as some other information related to termination of the simulator.

=== Initialization failure

If <<tools-cifsim-chapter-init,initialization>> of the specification fails, the simulation will terminate immediately.

indexterm:[CIF simulator,deadlock]

=== Deadlock

If simulation results in deadlock, no more transitions are possible, and the simulation will terminate.

Simulation does not immediately terminate when deadlock occurs, if an interactive <<tools-cifsim-input-chapter-index,input mode>> is used and <<tools-cifsim-input-chapter-history,history>> is enabled.
Instead, the user is asked whether to terminate the simulation, <<tools-cifsim-input-history-reset-undo,undo>> one or more transitions, or <<tools-cifsim-input-history-reset-undo,reset>> the simulation.

indexterm:[CIF simulator,simulation end time]

[[tools-cifsim-termination-endtime]]
=== Simulation end time

Using the _Simulation end time_ option (_Simulator_ category), the end time of the simulation can be configured.
By setting a simulation end time, you ensure that when the value of variable `time` reaches that value, the simulation terminates.

By default the simulation end time is set to 'infinite', which means that simulation termination is not limited by a simulation end time.
Settings a simulation end time also limits the <<tools-cifsim-solver-chapter-endtime-maxdelay,maximum duration of a time transition>>.

Simulation does not immediately terminate when the configured end time is reached, if an interactive <<tools-cifsim-input-chapter-index,input mode>> is used and <<tools-cifsim-input-chapter-history,history>> is enabled.
Instead, the user is asked whether to terminate the simulation, <<tools-cifsim-input-history-reset-undo,undo>> one or more transitions, or <<tools-cifsim-input-history-reset-undo,reset>> the simulation.

indexterm:[CIF simulator,runtime error]

=== Runtime error

If simulation results in a runtime error, the simulation will terminate immediately.

=== End of trace file

If the <<tools-cifsim-input-chapter-trace,trace input mode>> is used, and no more commands are available in the trace file, the simulation will terminate immediately.

=== User-requested termination

The user can manually request termination of the simulation in several ways.

Termination requests have no effect while the simulator interactively asks for input from the <<tools-cifsim-input-chapter-console,console>>.
However, once input is provided via the console and kbd:[Enter] is pressed, the termination request will be processed.

Termination requests issued between <<tools-cifsim-output-realtime-frames,intermediate frames>> are delayed until the next intermediate frame.

==== Interactive console input

Termination of the simulation can be requested, when using the interactive <<tools-cifsim-input-chapter-console,console>> input mode, by typing `q` and pressing kbd:[Enter], whenever the simulator interactively asks for input via the console.

==== Interactive GUI input

Termination of the simulation can be requested, when using the interactive <<tools-cifsim-input-chapter-gui,interactive GUI input mode>>, by closing the GUI of the interactive GUI input component, when the simulator asks for input via that GUI, or by clicking the console termination button.

==== Applications view

// Removed the previously present link to documentation about 'Applications view'.
The _Applications_ view has several termination features that may terminate any application, including the CIF simulator.
See the documentation for that view, for details.

==== Console termination button

Simulation can be terminated at any time, by using the _Terminate_ button (image:{tools-imgsdir}/cifsim/terminate_button.png[]), located at the upper right corner of the console.

Note however that if the console does not have the focus, this button may not be visible.
If the button is not visible, click somewhere in the console to make the button appear.
If even then the button is still not available, it may still appear if you _Maximize_ the console.
Due to these issues, use of the termination features of the _Applications_ view is recommended over using the _Terminate_ button of the console.
See the documentation for that view, for details.

==== Closing last real-time visualizer

If the last remaining <<tools-cifsim-output-realtime-outcomp,real-time output component>> (visualizer) is closed by the user, the simulator will be asked to terminate as soon as possible.

[[tools-cifsim-termination-confirm]]
=== Confirming termination

When simulating within Eclipse, all <<tools-cifsim-output-components,visualizers>> remain open, after the simulation has terminated.
This allows you to observe the final state of the simulation, before manually closing the visualizers.

When simulating on the command line (outside of Eclipse), termination of the simulator means that the visualizers are also closed.
To allow you to observe the final state of the simulation, you are asked to confirm termination of the simulator, and therefore closing of the visualizers, by pressing kbd:[Enter] at the console.

By default, you are only asked to confirm termination of the simulator when simulating on the command line (outside of Eclipse), at least one visualizer is visible at the end of the simulation, simulation did not result in a runtime error, and <<tools-cifsim-chapter-test-mode,test mode>> is disabled.
The _Ask to confirm simulator termination_ option (_Simulator_ category) can be used to configure whether the simulator asks the user to confirm termination of the simulator, terminate automatically, or decides by itself whether to ask the user for confirmation or terminate automatically.
The latter (letting the simulator decide by itself) is the default.
