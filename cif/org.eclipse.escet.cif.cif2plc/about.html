    <h4>PLCopen XML version 2.01 XSD file</h4>
    <p>
        The Content includes an XSD file distributed by PLCopen
        (<a href="https://www.plcopen.org/what-plcopen">https://www.plcopen.org/what-plcopen</a>).
    </p>

        On that download page, the XSD file can be downloaded as part of a ZIP file
