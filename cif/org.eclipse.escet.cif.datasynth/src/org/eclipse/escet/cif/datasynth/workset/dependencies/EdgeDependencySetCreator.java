     * Create the forward and backward edge dependency sets, and store them in the synthesis automaton.

     * <p>
     * For each edge 'e', its forward dependencies are those edges that may become enabled after taking edge 'e'. The
     * backward dependencies are inverted with respect to the forward ones.
     * </p>
     *
     * <p>
     * Note that the workset algorithm removes 'e' from the workset after it has been applied, after adding the
     * dependencies of 'e'. Hence, it does not matter whether an edge has itself as a dependency or not.
     * </p>
     *
     * <p>
     * Ideally, we'd compute the exact dependencies, but with arbitrary guard predicates and arbitrary assigned values
     * in updates, this is typically too complex to analyze statically. Hence, we compute an over-approximation. The
     * larger the over-approximation, the more edges are needlessly applied, impacting synthesis performance. The
     * dependencies must never be under-approximated, as that would make the workset algorithm invalid, since it then
     * may no longer reach all reachable states.
     * </p>
     *
     * @param synthAut The synthesis automaton. Is modified in-place.
     * @param forwardEnabled Whether forward reachability is enabled. If it is disabled, the forward edge dependency
     *     sets are not computed and thus also not stored in the synthesis automaton.
