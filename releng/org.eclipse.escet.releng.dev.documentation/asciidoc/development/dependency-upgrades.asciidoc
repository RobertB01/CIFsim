== Dependency upgrades

The Eclipse ESCET toolset has various dependencies.
From time to time, these dependencies need to be upgraded.
This page discusses for some of the major dependencies _when_ to upgrade and _how_ to upgrade:

* <<development-dependency-upgrades-eclipse>>
* <<development-dependency-upgrades-tycho>>
* <<development-dependency-upgrades-java>>

[[development-dependency-upgrades-eclipse]]
=== Eclipse Platform/IDE upgrades

The Eclipse ESCET IDE is based on the Eclipse IDE, which in turn is based on the Eclipse Platform.
The Eclipse IDE is also used as the development environment of choice for Eclipse ESCET development.

The Eclipse ESCET upgrade policy for the Eclipse Platform/IDE is:

* Considering the overhead, only upgrade if there is a use for it.
For instance, if we need a bug fix, some new feature, or so.
* Upgrade to a new Eclipse version at least once a year, to stay current.
* Consider the interplay between Eclipse and Java versions.
Upgrading Eclipse may require upgrading Java if the new Eclipse version has a higher minimum Java version requirement.
<<development-dependency-upgrades-java,Upgrading Java>> may require upgrading Eclipse to a newer version that supports that Java version.

To upgrade to a new Eclipse Platform/IDE version:

* Check out the information for the new version:
** Check the link:https://wiki.eclipse.org/Simultaneous_Release[Simultaneous Release] overview page for the link between platform version (e.g. _4.20_) and release name (e.g. _2021-06_).
** Check `https://www.eclipse.org/projects/project-plan.php?planurl=https://www.eclipse.org/eclipse/development/plans/eclipse_project_plan_N_NN.xml` with `N_NN` replaced by the platform version (e.g. `4_20`), for the project plan of the release, including detailed information about the supported target environments (operating systems, Java versions, etc).
** Check `https://www.eclipse.org/eclipse/development/readme_eclipse_N.NN.php` with `N.NN` replaced by the platform version (e.g. `4.20`), for the README of the release.
** Check the link:https://eclipseide.org/release/noteworthy/[New & Noteworthy] page for the new release and all intermediate releases since the previous version.
Note that you can switch to the New & Noteworthy pages of previous releases using the dropdown at the bottom of the page.

* Upgrade the development environment
** Alternative 1: set up a fresh new development environment.
*** The benefit of this alternative is that you get a clean new environment, and can use it side-by-side with existing development environments.
The downside is that you have to manually configure the new environment, or manually migrate your workspace and settings.
You also have to cleanup or remove your old development environments, in case you don't use them anymore.
*** <<development-dev-env-setup-chapter-index,Set up a new development environment>> for the new Eclipse IDE version.
** Alternative 2: in-place upgrade of an existing development environment.
*** The benefit of this alternative is that you can keep your existing environment, preventing multiple such environments as well as manual migrations.
The downside is that you run the risk of older things remaining in your development environment, requiring manual cleanup.
*** Update the _P2 Director_ section of the Oomph setup, if needed.
Especially, consider what is no longer compatible with the new Eclipse version and remove it, or replace it by an alternative.
*** If you removed anything from the _P2 Director_ section of the Oomph setup, also remove it manually from your development environment:
**** Click menu:Help[About Eclipse Platform].
**** Click the btn:[Installation Details] button.
**** Select on the _Installed Software_ tab the item to remove and click the btn:[Uninstall...] button.
**** On the _Uninstall_ dialog, click the btn:[Finish] button.
**** When asked to restart the Eclipse Platform, click btn:[Restart Now] (newer Eclipse versions) or btn:[Yes] (older Eclipse versions).
**** Repeat these steps for each item that was removed from the _P2 Director_ section of the Oomph setup.
*** Update your installation profile for the new Eclipse version, and apply it:
**** From the toolbar, select the dropdown menu of the menu:Open User[] item and choose menu:Open Installation[].
**** Select the _Installation file:..._ node.
**** In the _Properties_ view, change the _Product Version_ to the _Eclipse Platform_ edition of the new Eclipse version.
**** Save the `installation.setup` file.
**** Click menu:File[Restart].
**** Once Eclipse restarts, you may see some initialization progress at the bottom right corner of the development environment window.
**** Wait for the _Eclipse Update_ dialog to appear, indicating that _The installation does not satisfy the requirements listed below_.
**** Click the btn:[Install] button to update Eclipse.
**** Wait for the update to complete, while observing the progress at the bottom right corner of the development environment window.
**** If a _Trust_ dialog appears, click btn:[Select All] and then btn:[Trust Selected].
**** After some time, notice the Oomph icon with the flashing warning sign (image:{development-imgsdir}/oomph-icon-warning.png[]) at the bottom right corner of the development environment window.
**** Click it to open the _Eclipse Updater_ window.
**** Click btn:[Finish] to restart Eclipse, completing the update.
**** Once Eclipse restarts, you may see a _Older Workspace Version_ popup.
**** If so, click btn:[Continue] to update your workspace to the new Eclipse version.

* Version updates
** Look up the Orbit version for the new Eclipse Platform/IDE release, see https://download.eclipse.org/tools/orbit/downloads/.
** Update the target platform (`org.eclipse.escet.releng.target/org.eclipse.escet.releng.target.target`), configuring new versions for the Eclipse IDE and Orbit update sites.
** Update `dev-env-setup.asciidoc` to match the new Eclipse version.
** Update `org.eclipse.platform` version for the product feature (`org.eclipse.escet.product.feature/feature.xml`).
** Update Eclipse and Orbit update site URLs in the product (`org.eclipse.escet.product/escet.product`).
** Update Eclipse and Orbit update site URLs in the update site (`org.eclipse.escet.product/category.xml`).
** Update Maven plugin third party dependency versions to match the versions of these plugins from Orbit (`org.eclipse.escet.common.asciidoc/pom.xml`).
** Commit any changes.

* Update target platform and adapt to the new Eclipse version
** Let Oomph reactivate the target platform, and address any issues.
** Commit any changes.
** Force a rebuild in Eclipse (menu:Project[Clean...]).
** Check the workspace for any errors/warnings and address them if any.
** Commit any changes.
** Check _New and Noteworthy_ (release notes) of the new Eclipse version and relevant intermediate versions for changes and adapt as necessary.
** Commit any changes.

* Java formatter profile
** Right click the `org.eclipse.escet.common.java` project in the _Package Explorer_ view and choose menu:Properties[].
** In the properties dialog, select menu:Java Code Style[Formatter].
** Make sure the _Unmanaged profile_ is selected and click btn:[Edit...].
** Change the _Profile name_ to `tmp`.
** Click btn:[OK] to close the profile editing dialog, and then clicking btn:[Apply and Close] to close the properties dialog.
** Remove the _tmp_ profile:
*** Remove the `formatter_profile=_tmp` line from the `.settings/org.eclipse.jdt.ui.prefs` file in the project.
*** Navigate to menu:Window[Preferences].
*** In the dialog, navigate to menu:Java[Code Style > Formatter].
*** Select the _tmp_ profile.
*** Click the btn:[Remove] button and confirm the removal by clicking btn:[Yes].
*** Close the preference dialog by clicking btn:[Apply and Close].
*** If an Oomph preference recorder dialog appears, dismiss it by clicking btn:[Cancel].
** If in the  `org.eclipse.escet.common.java` project, in the `.settings` directory, there are changes to any of the `*.prefs` files:
*** Run `./copy_here.bash ../../common/org.eclipse.escet.common.java` from `misc/java-code-style` to copy the new preferences to the central place.
*** Run `./copy_there.bash` from `misc/java-code-style` to copy the new preferences to all relevant projects.
*** Refresh all projects, and wait until the rebuild completes.
*** Commit the preference changes.
*** Reformat all projects.
*** Commit any code changes.
** In case of new formatter preferences, configure them as desired.
Apply each preference change separately, to allow easier reviewing:
*** Change a single formatter preference on the `org.eclipse.escet.common.java` project.
This requires giving the unmanaged profile the name _tmp_ again, as before.
*** Remove the _tmp_ profile, as before.
*** Run `./copy_here.bash ../../common/org.eclipse.escet.common.java` from `misc/java-code-style` to copy the changed formatter preference to the central place.
*** Run `./copy_there.bash` from `misc/java-code-style` to copy the changed formatter preference to all relevant projects.
*** Refresh all projects, and wait until the rebuild completes.
*** Commit the preference changes.
*** Reformat all projects.
*** Commit reformatting changes.
** If any changes were made to the formatter preferences, manually update the `org.eclipse.escet.*.metamodel` projects to have the same formatter settings as the rest of the projects.

* Java errors/warnings settings
** Right click the `org.eclipse.escet.common.java` project in the _Package Explorer_ view and choose menu:Properties[].
** In the properties dialog, select menu:Java Compiler[Errors/Warnings].
** Make a dummy change and apply it by clicking btn:[Apply and Close].
** Click btn:[Yes] when asked to _Rebuild the project now to apply the changes of the Error/Warning settings?_.
** Revert the dummy change, using again the same steps.
** In case of changes to `*.prefs` files in the `.settings` directory of that project, configure the new preferences as desired.
** Run `./copy_here.bash ../../common/org.eclipse.escet.common.java` from `misc/java-code-style` to copy the new preferences to the central place.
** Run `./copy_there.bash` from `misc/java-code-style` to copy the new preferences to all relevant projects.
** Force a rebuild in Eclipse (menu:Project[Clean...]) and check for any warnings/errors, addressing them if any.

* Update Maven version
** Check the embedded Maven version, by navigating to menu:Run[Run Configurations...], selecting the _build_ launch configuration under _Maven Build_, and observing the _Maven Runtime_ version.
** Ensure the Maven version in `Jenkinsfile` matches the embedded Maven version.
** Ensure the Maven version in `misc/license-check-dependencies/Jenkinsfile` matches the embedded Maven version.
** Update versions of Maven plugins (`maven-plugin-*`) to match new Maven version (`org.eclipse.escet.common.asciidoc/pom.xml`).
** Update version of the `maven-plugin-plugin` if needed (`org.eclipse.escet.releng.configuration/pom.xml`).

* Validation
** Run a <<development-building-and-testing-chapter-index,Maven build>>.
** Ensure no errors or warnings during Maven build.

* Dependency information
** Run `misc/license-check-dependencies/license-check-dependencies.sh` and update `DEPENDENCIES.txt` according to the output.
** Run `misc/license-check-dependencies/license-check-dependencies.sh` again, to ensure `DEPENDENCIES.txt` is up-to-date.

[[development-dependency-upgrades-tycho]]
=== Tycho upgrades

Eclipse Tycho is used for the Eclipse ESCET build.

The Eclipse ESCET upgrade policy for Tycho is:

* Typically upgrading to a newer version can be done at any time, if it is considered relevant.

To upgrade to a new Tycho version:

* Update `version` in `org.eclipse.escet.root/.mvn/extensions.xml`.
* Update `tycho.version` in `org.eclipse.escet.releng.configuration/pom.xml`.
* Update `maven.minimal.version` in `org.eclipse.escet.releng.configuration/pom.xml`, if the new Tycho version requires a higher Maven version.
* Check Tycho release notes for changes and adapt as necessary.
* Run a <<development-building-and-testing-chapter-index,Maven build>>.
* Ensure no errors or warnings during Maven build.

[[development-dependency-upgrades-java]]
=== Java upgrades

Most of the Eclipse ESCET source code is written in Java.

The Eclipse ESCET upgrade policy for Java is:

* Considering the overhead, only upgrade if there is a use for it.
For instance, if we need a bug fix, some new feature, or so.
* Upgrade when a Java version we use is no longer actively supported.
* Only upgrade to a Java LTS release.
* Don't upgrade to newer Java versions immediately, but only after (industrial) adoption is high enough.
As a general guideline, if at least 50% of developers, users and enterprises use the new LTS version, consider upgrading.
Java usage is regularly surveyed, and reports can typically be found online.
For instance, the link:https://outreach.jakartaee.org/2021-developer-survey-report[2021 Jakarta EE Developer Survey Report] of the Eclipse Jakarta EE project indicates that in 2021 about 58% of the developers and 11% of the enterprises used Java 11.
* Consider the interplay between Java and Eclipse versions.
Upgrading Java may require upgrading Eclipse to a newer version that supports that Java version.
<<development-dependency-upgrades-eclipse,Upgrading Eclipse>> may require upgrading Java if the new Eclipse version has a higher minimum Java version requirement.

To upgrade to a new Java version:

* For major Java versions (e.g. 17 to 18):
** Update all (plugin) projects:
*** Update `Bundle-RequiredExecutionEnvironment` for all plug-in manifests.
*** Update `JRE_CONTAINER` in all `.classpath` files.
*** Update `JRE_CONTAINER` in all launch configurations (`.launch` files).
*** Update Java versions in all `org.eclipse.jdt.core.prefs` files (`compiler.codegen.targetPlatform`, `compiler.compliance`, and `compiler.source`).
** Update all metamodel projects (`org.eclipse.escet.*.metamodel` projects):
*** Update the `autofix.py` scripts of these projects, by changing the compliance level resulting from replacements.
*** Change in all `*.genmodel` files the `complianceLevel`.
*** Regenerate the model code for each metamodel project, by opening the corresponding `.genmodel` file, right clicking the root node of the opened generator model, and choosing menu:Generate Model Code[].
There won't always be changes.
** Update the product:
*** Update `osgi.requiredJavaVersion` in the product (`org.eclipse.escet.product/escet.product`).
*** Update `osgi.requiredJavaVersion` in the product launch configuration (`org.eclipse.escet.product/*.launch`).
** Update the build:
*** Update Java version for `escet.java.version` in `org.eclipse.escet.releng.configuration/pom.xml`.
*** Update Java version for `executionEnvironment` in `org.eclipse.escet.releng.configuration/pom.xml`.
*** Update Java version in `Jenkinsfile`.
*** Update Java version in `misc/license-check-dependencies/Jenkinsfile`.
** Update all Java code and documentation:
*** Update Java keywords for `org.eclipse.escet.common.java.JavaCodeUtils.JAVA_IDS`.
Update the keywords themselves and the field's JavaDoc, including the link to the Java Language Specification (JLS).
*** Update `dev-env-setup.asciidoc` to match new Java version.
*** Update links to specific versions of the Java documentation (search for `https://docs.oracle.com`).
** Search for the current Java version to find other references (e.g., search for `17`).

* For any Java versions (e.g. 17 to 18, or 17.0.1 to 17.0.2):
** Update the JustJ update site URL in the target platform (`org.eclipse.escet.releng.target/org.eclipse.escet.releng.target.target`).
** Re-activate the target platform using Oomph.
** Update JustJ version for the product feature (`org.eclipse.escet.product.feature/feature.xml`).
** Force a rebuild in Eclipse (menu:Project[Clean...]) and check for any warnings/errors, addressing them if any.
** Run a <<development-building-and-testing-chapter-index,Maven build>>.
** Ensure no errors or warnings during Maven build.
** Run `misc/license-check-dependencies/license-check-dependencies.sh` and update `DEPENDENCIES.txt` according to the output.
** Run `misc/license-check-dependencies/license-check-dependencies.sh` to ensure `DEPENDENCIES.txt` is up-to-date.
