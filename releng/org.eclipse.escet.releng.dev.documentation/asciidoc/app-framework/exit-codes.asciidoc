[[app-framework-exit-codes]]
== Exit codes

Application framework applications can terminate with the following exit codes:

* `0`: Application finished without errors.
* `1`: Application finished after reporting an error to the end user.
* `2`: Application crashed after running out of memory.
* `3`: Application crashed for any reason other than running out of memory.

Note that applications themselves should always return a zero exit code.
The other exit codes are generated automatically by the exception framework when applicable.

Any exceptions to these rules should generally be avoided, but otherwise must be clearly documented for end users.
