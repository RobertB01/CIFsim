The Eclipse Supervisory Control Engineering Toolkit (Eclipse ESCET(TM)) project is an link:https://eclipse.org[Eclipse Foundation] open-source project that provides a toolkit for the development of supervisory controllers in the Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) paradigm.
The toolkit has a strong focus on model-based design, supervisory controller synthesis, and industrial applicability, for example to cyber-physical systems.
The toolkit supports the entire development process of (supervisory) controllers, from modeling, supervisory controller synthesis, simulation-based validation and visualization, and formal verification, to real-time testing and implementation.
