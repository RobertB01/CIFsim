= Security Policy

The Eclipse ESCET(TM) project follows the https://www.eclipse.org/security/policy.php[Eclipse Vulnerability Reporting Policy].
Vulnerabilities are tracked by the Eclipse security team, in cooperation with the ESCET project leads.
Fixing vulnerabilities is taken care of by the ESCET project committers, with assistance and guidance of the security team.

== Supported Versions

Whenever the Eclipse ESCET project fixes a vulnerability, it will be included in the next release.

== Reporting a Vulnerability

We recommend that in case of suspected vulnerabilities you do not use the ESCET public issue tracker, but instead contact the Eclipse Security Team directly via security@eclipse.org.
