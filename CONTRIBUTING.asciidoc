# Contributing to Eclipse ESCET

Thanks for your interest in this project.


## Project description

The Eclipse Supervisory Control Engineering Toolkit (Eclipse ESCET) project
provides a toolkit for the development of supervisory controllers. The toolkit
has a strong focus on industrial applicability, e.g. to cyber-physical
systems. The toolkit includes tooling to support the entire development
process of (supervisory) controllers, including among others specification,
supervisory controller synthesis, simulation-based validation and
visualization, formal verification, real-time testing, and code generation.
