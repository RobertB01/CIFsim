== Project description

The Eclipse Supervisory Control Engineering Toolkit (Eclipse ESCET(TM)) project provides a toolkit for the development of supervisory controllers.
The toolkit has a strong focus on industrial applicability, e.g. to cyber-physical systems.
The toolkit includes tooling to support the entire development process of (supervisory) controllers, including among others specification, supervisory controller synthesis, simulation-based validation and visualization, formal verification, real-time testing, and code generation.

== Developer resources

For more information regarding source code management, builds, setting up a developer environment, coding standards, how to contribute, and more, see the Eclipse ESCET development documentation at:

* https://eclipse.dev/escet/development

The project maintains the following source code repositories:

* Main repository: https://gitlab.eclipse.org/eclipse/escet/escet.git
* Website repository: https://gitlab.eclipse.org/eclipse/escet/escet-website.git

These can also be accessed via a web interface:

* Main repository: https://gitlab.eclipse.org/eclipse/escet/escet
* Website repository: https://gitlab.eclipse.org/eclipse/escet/escet-website

The main repository has released content in its `master` branch, and current developments go into the `develop` branch.
New website versions are generally deployed from the build of the main repository.
Changes should therefore typically be made to the main repository, rather than directly to the website repository.

This project uses GitLab to track ongoing development and issues:

* https://gitlab.eclipse.org/eclipse/escet/escet/-/milestones
* https://gitlab.eclipse.org/eclipse/escet/escet/-/issues

Since the website repository does not have its own issue tracker, issues for the website should be made on the main repository as well.
Be sure to search for existing issues before you create another one.
Remember that contributions are always welcome!

To contribute source code (e.g. patches) via GitLab, see:

* https://eclipse.dev/escet/development/development/contributing.html

To create issues, reply to issues, contribute patches and merge requests, etc, you need an Eclipse Foundation account.
It can easily be created at https://accounts.eclipse.org/user/register.

Please start each commit message with the issue number, e.g. `#NNN Commit summary.` for issue `NNN`.

The main repository can be built using the `build.sh` or `build.cmd` script located in the root of that repository.
