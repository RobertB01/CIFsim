# Contributing to Eclipse ESCET

Thanks for your interest in this project.


## Project description

The Eclipse Supervisory Control Engineering Toolkit (Eclipse ESCET) project
provides a toolkit for the development of supervisory controllers. The toolkit
has a strong focus on industrial applicability, e.g. to cyber physical
systems. The toolkit includes tooling to support the entire development
process of (supervisory) controllers, including among others specification,
supervisory controller synthesis, simulation-based validation and
visualization, formal verification, real-time testing, and code generation.
