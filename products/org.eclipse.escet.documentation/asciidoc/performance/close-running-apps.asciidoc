== Closing running applications

One of the nice features of an the Eclipse ESCET IDE is that it allows the
simultaneous execution of multiple applications, as well as the simultaneous
execution of a single application on many different inputs. For instance, it
is possible to simultaneously simulate two models using a simulator. The
downside is that running multiple applications at the same time, costs more
memory. Sometimes, if you forget to close an application, it can still
consume memory, and may even still be running active computations, thus
consuming processing power.


=== Application management via the applications view

The <<use-apps-view,Applications view>> can also be used observe the
<<use-apps-view-status,status>> of running applications, and to
<<use-apps-view-termination,terminate>> them.


=== Application management via the console view

The Eclipse _Console_ <<use-terminology-view,view>> maintains the console
output for all running and finished applications. To look at the applications
that you executed, click the small arrow next to the _Display Selected Console_
icon (image:{performance-imgsdir}/console_pages.png[]) of the _Console_ view's
toolbar. A list of executed applications will appear, that looks something
like this:

image::{performance-imgsdir}/console_pages_list.png[]

In this case, of the four applications that have been started, the second and
fourth are still running. The console for the fourth application is currently
displayed, as indicated by the selection indicator on the left. Clicking on any
of the other applications will activate the console for that application,
allowing it to be terminated, thus freeing resources for other applications.

The application that is currently active in the console can be terminated at
any time, by using the _Terminate_ button
(image:{performance-imgsdir}/terminate_button.png[]),
located at the upper right corner of the console. Note however that if the
console does not have the focus, this button may not be visible. If the button
is not visible, click somewhere in the console to make the button appear. If
even then the button is still not available, it may still appear if you
_Maximize_ the console. Also note that the button has no effect
while the application interactively asks for input from the console. However,
once the console input is provided, and kbd:[ENTER] is pressed, the
termination request will be processed.
