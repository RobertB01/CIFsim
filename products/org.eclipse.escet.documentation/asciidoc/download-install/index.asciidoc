== Download and install Eclipse ESCET toolkit

WARNING: The Eclipse ESCET project and all its tools are currently in the
link:https://wiki.eclipse.org/Development_Resources/Process_Guidelines/What_is_Incubation[Incubation Phase].

You can download Eclipse ESCET from the following locations:

* link:https://download.eclipse.org/escet[Eclipse ESCET downloads] (for recent versions)
* link:https://archive.eclipse.org/escet[Eclipse ESCET archived downloads] (for older versions)

Downloads for Eclipse ESCET tools are available for the following platforms:

* Windows, x64 (64-bit)
* Linux, x64 (64-bit)
* macOS, x64 (64-bit)

The downloads are archives that can be extracted anywhere on the local system.
Each download contains the Eclipse ESCET toolkit, with the tools available in
two ways:

* As IDE based on the Eclipse IDE, providing the full experience. Includes
full GUI integration and e.g. text editors with syntax highlighting and error
checking.

* As command line execution scripts (`bin` directory of the archives),
allowing execution in a command line terminal or console,
particularly useful for execution of the tools on headless clusters. The
command line scripts are only available for Windows and Linux, not for macOS.

indexterm:[dependencies]

The following dependencies need to be available on the system:

indexterm:[jdk]
indexterm:[jre]
indexterm:[java]

* Java Development Kit (JDK):
** Version 8 update 31 (8u31) or newer is required. Versions 9 and higher are
currently not yet supported.
** An x64 (64-bit) version of Java is required, which also requires a 64-bit
operating system.
** Currently the Eclipse ESCET tools are only tested using Oracle JDKs. Your
experience with other JDK vendors may vary.
** A Java Runtime Environment (JRE) is not sufficient. A JDK is required.

The tools are also available as plug-ins for the Eclipse IDE, by means of an
Eclipse P2 update site.
