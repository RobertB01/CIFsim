== Removing Eclipse ESCET tools

Before removing a version of the Eclipse ESCET tools, you may want to preserve
(back up) its <<use-terminology-workspace,workspace>> directory, to keep your
data (settings, projects, files). Then, to remove a release, simply remove the
directory that contains files that you extracted from the downloaded archive
during <<download-install-install,installation>>.

Additionally, you may want to remove Java if you no longer need it.
