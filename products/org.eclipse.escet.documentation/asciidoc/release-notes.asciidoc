=== Version 0.1

The first release of the Eclipse ESCET project and toolkit.
This release is based on the initial contribution by the Eindhoven University
of Technology (TU/e).

Most notable changes compared to the last TU/e release:

- A JDK is no longer bundled with the downloads. A JDK must be installed
separately and manually. Future releases will again include a JDK.

This release is based on the Eclipse IDE version 2020-06 and supports Java 8.
