== Contributing

Thanks for your interest in Eclipse Supervisory Control Engineering Toolkit
(Eclipse ESCET) project.

It is often a good idea to first discuss your contribution with the project's
community and committers, before creating the actual code (e.g. patches),
documentation, etc of your contribution. Discussions can take place via an
<<developer-issue-tracking-chapter-index,issue>> in the issue tracker, or on
the project's <<developer-chapter-index,'dev' list>>.

To contribute your actual contribution, e.g. code, documentation, examples,
or anything else to the project, please first create an issue in the
<<developer-issue-tracking-chapter-index,issue tracker>>.

To contribute the actual contribution, please use GitLab:

* link:https://gitlab.eclipse.org/eclipse/escet/escet/-/merge_requests[Eclipse ESCET GitLab merge requests]

indexterm:[ECA]

Before your contribution can be accepted by the project team, contributors must
electronically sign the Eclipse Contributor Agreement (ECA):

* link:https://www.eclipse.org/legal/ECA.php[Eclipse Contributor Agreement (ECA)]

Commits that are provided by non-committers must have a `Signed-off-by` field in
the footer indicating that the author is aware of the terms by which the
contribution has been provided to the project. The non-committer must
additionally have an Eclipse Foundation account and must have a signed Eclipse
Contributor Agreement (ECA) on file.

For more information, including the specific format of commit messages,
please see the Eclipse Foundation Project Handbook:

* link:https://www.eclipse.org/projects/handbook[Eclipse Foundation Project Handbook]
* link:https://www.eclipse.org/projects/handbook/#resources-commit[Git Commit Records]

A contribution by a non-committer will be reviewed by the project committers.
This includes adherence to the project's
<<developer-coding-standards-chapter-index,coding standards>>. Discussions
regarding the contribution will take place in the associated issue and/or
pull request. If the committers agree with the contribution, they will commit
the contribution into the project's Git repository.

Remember that contributions are always welcome, and contributions don't have
to be perfect. The project's developers can help to improve your contribution.
If you need any help, just ask the project's developers using the issue or the
project's <<develop-dev-list,'dev' list>>.

See for more information our
<<developer-development-process-chapter-index,development process>>.
