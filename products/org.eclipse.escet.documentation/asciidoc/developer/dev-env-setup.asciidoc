button.

indexterm:[oomph, setup]
indexterm:[development, environment]

To create a development environment for the first time:

* Start the Eclipse Installer that you downloaded.
* Use the hamburger menu at the top right to switch to advanced mode.
* For Windows:
** When asked to keep the installer in a permanent location, choose to do so.
Select a directory of your choosing.
** The Eclipse installer will start automatically in advanced mode, from the
new permanent location.
* For Linux:
** The Eclipse installer will restart in advanced mode.
* Continue with non-first time instructions for setting up a development
environment.

To create a development environment for a non-first time:

* In the first wizard window:
** Select _Eclipse Platform_ from the big list at the top.
** Select _2021-03_ for _Product Version_.
** For _Java 11+ VM_ select
_JRE 11.0.2 - \http://download.eclipse.org/justj/jres/11/updates/release/11.0.2_.
** Choose whether you want a P2 bundle pool (recommended).
** Click btn:[Next].
* In the second wizard window:
** Use the green '+' icon at the top right to add the Oomph setup.
*** For _Catalog_, choose _Eclipse Projects_.
*** For _Resource URIs_, enter
`+https://gitlab.eclipse.org/eclipse/escet/escet/-/raw/develop/org.eclipse.escet.setup+`
and make sure there are no spaces before or after the URL.
*** Click btn:[OK].
** Check the checkbox for _Eclipse ESCET_, from the big list. It is under _Eclipse
Projects_ / _<User>_.
** At the bottom right, select the _develop_ stream.
** Click btn:[Next].
* In the third wizard window:
** Enable the _Show all variables_ option to show all options.
** Choose a _Root install folder_ and _Installation folder name_.
The new development environment will be put at
`<root_installation_folder>/<installation_folder_name>`.
** For _Eclipse Foundation account full name_ fill in your full name (first
and last name) matching the full name in your Eclipse Foundation account.
** For _Eclipse Foundation account email address_ fill in the email address
associated with your Eclipse Foundation account.
** Click btn:[Next].
* In the fourth wizard window:
** Select btn:[Finish].
* Wait for the setup to complete and the development environment to be
launched.
** If asked, accept any licenses and certificates.
* Press btn:[Finish] in the Eclipse Installer to close the Eclipse Installer.
* In the new development environment, observe Oomph executing the startup
tasks (such as Git clone, importing projects, etc). If this is not
automatically shown, click the rotating arrows icon in the status bar
(bottom right) of the new development environment.
* Wait for the startup tasks to finish successfully.
* NOTE: If you don't open the Oomph dialog, the status bar icon icon may
disappear when the tasks are successfully completed.

If you have any issues during setting up the development environment, consider
the following:

* Make sure to use a recent version of the Eclipse Installer. These versions
include a recent JRE, which includes up-to-date certificates, preventing issues
when accessing https URLs.
* You can set the following environment variables to force the use of IPv4, in
case of any issues accessing/downloading remote files:
+
[source]
----
_JAVA_OPTIONS=-Djava.net.preferIPv4Stack=true
_JPI_VM_OPTIONS=-Djava.net.preferIPv4Stack=true
----
+
After setting them, make sure to fully close the Eclipse Installer and then
start it again, for the changes to be picked up.

In your new development environment, consider changing the following settings:

* For the _Package Explorer_ <<use-terminology-view,view>>:

** Enable the _Link with Editor_ setting, using the
image:{developer-imgsdir}/link-with-editor.png[] icon.

** Enable showing resources (files/folders) with names starting with a period.
Open the _View Menu_ (image:{developer-imgsdir}/view-menu.png[]) and choose
menu:Filters...[]. Uncheck the `+.* resources+` option and click btn:[OK].
