[[multivalue-goals]]
## Goals

Decision trees are a useful data structure to store a large amount of relations.
Most software packages in this area aim for maximum storage and efficiency,
implement them with binary decision diagrams (BDDs) and leave all details of
handling nodes to the end-application for maximum flexibility.

This package uses multi-value decision diagrams (MDDs) instead, and attempts to
keep details of handling nodes away from the application programmer. The
advantage of these choices is that using the package is simpler, in particular
with variables that have more than two possible values. The downside is that
this implementation is less feature rich, and is less efficient.

As a result, this package works well for applications that need to manipulate
relations with many variables with a larger domain, where usage of the
application is not expected to go near the limits of the computer running it.
