== Eclipse ESCET perspective

The layout of the different parts of the Eclipse ESCET IDE, including the
position and size of the various <<use-terminology-view,views>>, can be
configured per perspective. Different perspectives allow you to use different
layouts for different tasks.

The Eclipse ESCET IDE ships with some built-in perspectives. The default
_ESCET_ perspective is ideally suited for the use of the Eclipse
ESCET software.

indexterm:[perspective,open]
indexterm:[perspective,switch]
You can manually open the _ESCET_ perspective (or any other perspective), by
selecting menu:Window[Perspective > Open Perspective > Other...]. Then, in the
_Open Perspective_ dialog, select the _ESCET_ perspective from the list, and
click the btn:[OK] button.

indexterm:[perspective,active]
indexterm:[perspective,switch]
By default, the Eclipse ESCET IDE shows the opened perspectives at the top
right corner of the IDE. Each perspective is a button that can be used to
active it. If the button appears in a pushed state, that perspective is
active. The following image shows an Eclipse ESCET IDE with two open
perspectives: the _Resource_ perspective and the _ESCET_ perspective.
The _ESCET_ perspective  is the currently enabled perspective.

By default, the _ESCET_ perspective shows the following views:

indexterm:[perspective,default views]
indexterm:[view,Project Explorer]
indexterm:[view,applications]
indexterm:[view,problems]
indexterm:[view,properties]
indexterm:[view,console]

* Project explorer (top left)
* <<use-apps-view,Applications>> (bottom left)
* Problems (bottom, grouped)
* Properties (bottom, grouped)
* Console (bottom, grouped)

indexterm:[perspective,layout]
indexterm:[perspective,reset]
You can manually <<use-terminology-view-open,open>> additional
<<use-terminology-view,views>>, close some views, move views around,
change the size of the different views, etc. If at any time you wish to go
back to the original layout, you can reset the perspective, by selecting
menu:Window[Perspective > Reset Perspective...]. Click the btn:[OK]
button to confirm.

indexterm:[perspective,default layout]
indexterm:[perspective,default views]
Whenever a new release changes the default layout of a perspective, for
instance by adding a new default view, you can reset the perspective to get
the new view, or you can <<use-terminology-view-open,open>> that view it
manually.
