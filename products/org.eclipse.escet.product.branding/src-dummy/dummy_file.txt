The 'plugin.properties' file contains replacement patterns. We use the Maven
Resources Plugin to replace them during build. The property file with replaced
patterns is placed by the Maven Resources Plugin into the project build output
directory. Since this plug-in doesn't have any sources, and thus no files are
otherwise placed in the project build output directory, Tycho is not aware
that it needs to copy the files from the project build output directory into
the plug-in JAR. As such, this plug-in has been configured to have a dummy
source directory, to ensure Tycho does copy the property file with the
replacements. To ensure that the dummy source directory is part of the Git
repository, and since Git can't store empty directories, this dummy file is
added to the dummy source directory. Unfortunately, this dummy file also
becomes part of the JAR file.
